<blockquote>
<p>On a foggy night in San Francisco, you set off in your jetski at 9:30 PM, zipping across San Francisco Bay at <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span>mph on a heading of <span class="math inline">\(105^\circ\)</span>. Simultaneously, your friend Lee leaves from a marina in Oakland due east of your marina in SF, traveling at a heading of <span class="math inline">\(195^\circ\)</span>. Later, other boaters will tell police that they heard screams and saw a large fireball in the Bay. What happened? When? What was Lee’s average speed before the crash?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you got through this problem, you may have realized that you need to know how far apart the two marinas are in order to solve it. Well, that’s no problem! You can just look up how far apart SF and Oakland are! Of course, we don’t know exactly where these marinas are, but that’s OK—we can figure this out, contingent on the distance.</p>
<p>So, using Google Maps, perhaps I left in my jetski from Mission Bay, and perhaps Lee left from a jetty in Alameda (not technically Oakland, but whatever). Those two spots are, according to Google Maps, <span class="math inline">\(4.36\)</span> miles apart:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-33-1.png" /></p>
<p>Of course if you use a different number, you’ll get a slightly different answer, but that’s fine. Anyway, we know the <strong>headings</strong> that Lee and I take from the marinas. A heading is an angular measurement from due north, rotating clockwise. So, for example, a heading of <span class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span> is going due east, a heading of <span class="math inline">\(180^\circ\)</span> is going due south, and so forth. So my heading of <span class="math inline">\(105^\circ\)</span> will make my trajectory look like this:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-33-2.png" /></p>
<p>And Lee’s heading of <span class="math inline">\(195^\circ\)</span> will make her trajectory look like this:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-33-3.png" /></p>
<p>So somewhere, we’ll crash! But where? And when?!?! I guess we can figure this out using triangles and trig and such! First of all, let’s figure out what the two small, somewhat more relevant angles are:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-33-4.png" /></p>
<p>OK. So we have a triangle with a <span class="math inline">\(75^\circ\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(15^\circ\)</span> angle. Because all the angles have to add up to <span class="math inline">\(180^\circ\)</span>, we know the third angle must be <span class="math inline">\(90^\circ\)</span>. So it’s a right triangle! And thus it’s easy to do trig with.</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-33-5.png" /></p>
<p>Had we had more time, we’d have constructed a <span class="math inline">\(75^\circ-15^\circ-90^\circ\)</span> special right triangle, which we could have used here! But we didn’t have time this semester. Very sad. If you want to see it anyway, here’s what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="../15-75-90-special-right-triangle.png" /></p>
<p>How long are the other two sides of our triangle? That’s the tricky part. We know the hypotenuse—that’s the <span class="math inline">\(4.36\)</span> miles that Google Maps told us. But what about the side lengths? Let’s use a variable. We know I’m going <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span> miles per hour, so let’s label my side has having length <span class="math inline">\(23t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the time (in hours) until we crash:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-33-6.png" /></p>
<p>Lee’s side I guess we can label as having length <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{Lee}\cdot t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{Lee}\)</span> is her speed. We don’t know what that is, but hopefully we’ll be able to figure it out.</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-33-7.png" /></p>
<p>Now let’s do some trig!!! Let’s figure out how long it was until the crash. We can approach this in lots of ways. One way is to take the sine of <span class="math inline">\(75^\circ\)</span>, which must be opposite over hypotenuse, or:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sin\left(75^\circ\right) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}\]</span></p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sin\left(75^\circ\right) = \frac{23t}{4.36}\]</span></p>
<p>So, we can solve for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t = \frac{4.36\sin\left(75^\circ\right)}{23}\]</span></p>
<p>We can work out <span class="math inline">\(\sin\left(75^\circ\right)\)</span> with a calculator, or, if we know the special triangle, directly:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t = \frac{4.36}{23}\cdot\left(\frac{\sqrt3+1}{2\sqrt2}\right) \text{ hours}\]</span></p>
<p>Approximating all this with a calculator, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t \approx .1831 \text{ hours}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t \approx 10.98 \text{ minutes}\]</span></p>
<p>Only eleven minutes!!! So I guess the crash happened at <span class="math inline">\(\boxed{9:41 \text{ PM}}\)</span>. What was Lee’s speed? We could work this out in multiple ways. If we use a tangent, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>s cancel nicely:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tan\left(75^\circ\right) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tan\left(75^\circ\right) = \frac{23t}{V_\text{Lee}t}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tan\left(75^\circ\right) = \frac{23}{V_\text{Lee}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{Lee}= \frac{23}{ \tan\left(75^\circ\right) }\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{Lee}= \frac{23}{\quad \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{\sqrt3-1} \quad }\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{ V_\text{Lee} \approx 6.16 \text{ miles per hour} }\]</span></p>
<p>Six miles per hour! Very slow. (Note here that we don’t need to use the distance to find Lee’s average speed—it’s totally independent! The number “<span class="math inline">\(4.36\)</span>”" never came up in our calculations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somewhere in Canada’s frozen north, a poacher is setting a trap for a polar bear. Unbeknownst to him, a polar bear has noticed, and is running toward the poacher to teach him a lesson in Arctic ethics. The poacher’s friend, watching in horror, tries to warn the poacher, but they’re a half-mile apart, and the poacher can’t hear his friend shouting for him to turn around. The friend, meanwhile, has a compass with him, and observes that over a thirty-second period, the angle between the two friends and the bear (i.e., the angle given by poacher–friend–bear) decreases from <span class="math inline">\(\pi/3\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\pi/4\)</span>. (You can assume that the polar bear is running on a course perpendicular to the line between the two friends, i.e., that the angle friend–poacher–bear is a right angle.) When will the polar bear enjoy his sashimi? (Be sure to give proper units.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I guess we start with a situation like this:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-34-1.png" /></p>
<p>I’m sorry for not drawing actual pictures of the characters, which would be way more fun. The problem says that “over a thirty-second period, the angle between the two friends and the bear (i.e., the angle given by poacher–friend–bear) decreases from <span class="math inline">\(\pi/3\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\pi/4\)</span>”, which means that I guess the situation initially looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-34-2.png" /></p>
<p>And then, after thirty seconds, like this:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-34-3.png" /></p>
<p>We want to figure out when the bear will reach the poacher, so that means we need to figure out a) how far away the bear has left to run, and b) how fast the bear is going.</p>
<p>To figure out how far the bear has left to run, we can notice that this is a special <span class="math inline">\(\pi/4-\pi/4-\pi/4\)</span> right triangle, which has two legs of the same length. The distance from the poacher to his friend is half a mile (though this is in Canada, so it should really be in kilometers), so the distance remaining from the poacher to the bear is half a mile:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-34-4.png" /></p>
<p>But how fast is the bear going? How far did it run in those thirty seconds? We can notice that this bigger triangle is a <span class="math inline">\(\pi/3-\pi/6-\pi/2\)</span> special right triangle, and since it has a side opposite <span class="math inline">\(\pi/3\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, the adjacent side must be <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3}/2\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="trig-word-problem-34-5.png" /></p>
<p>So then, to figure out the polar bear’s speed, we can remember that distance is rate times time:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{distance} = \text{speed}\cdot\text{time}\]</span></p>
<p>I.e., speed is distance divided by time:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\]</span></p>
<p>So, what’s the change in distance? What’s the change in time? We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\text{speed} &amp;= \frac{\,\frac{\sqrt3}{2}-\frac12}{30 \text{ seconds}} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt3-1}{60} \text{ miles/second} \\ \\
&amp;\approx .02440\text{ miles/second} \\ \\
&amp;\approx 43.92\text{ miles/hour}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>That’s a pretty fast bear!!! When will he reach the poacher? Again, we know that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{distance} = \text{speed}\cdot\text{time}\]</span></p>
<p>So then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\text{time} &amp;= \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{1/2 \text{ mile}}{\frac{\sqrt3-1}{60} \text{ miles/second}} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{30}{\sqrt3-1} \text{ seconds} \\ \\
&amp;\approx 40.98\text{ seconds}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus always to poachers!</p>
