<h1 class="title">Radical Angle Measurement</h1>
</header>
<p>How do we measure angles? We usually measure them in degrees: <img src="degree-angle-examples.svg" style="width:75.0%" /> But why degrees? In a complete revolution of a circle, there are 360 degrees. Whence 360? Isn’t that kind of an awkward number? Why not define a “degree” such that all the degrees in a circle add up to 100 degrees? or 10 degrees?</p>
<p>Or maybe we could measure angles as a percent. We could say that the measure of the angle of a full circle is <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), and then a <span class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span> angle would be the same as a <span class="math inline">\(25\%\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span>) angle, a <span class="math inline">\(135\degree\)</span> angle would be equivalent to a <span class="math inline">\(37.5\%\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(0.375\)</span>) angle, and so forth. This would be a natural way of measuring an angle. Rather than being based on the arbitrariness of the number “<span class="math inline">\(360\)</span>,” it would use the much more natural choice of the number <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another way to measure angles—the way we’ll use—involves pizza. Pizza is great! Pizza is so delicious. The only thing better than pizza is <em>really symmetrical pizza</em>. Imagine we have a strong predisposition for geometric symmetry, and so we want the crust of our piece of pizza to be the same length as the two cheesey sides, like so: <img src="pizza.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> (Note that we’re measuring the crust on the outside edge.) So we want an equilateral piece of pizza. Sort of like an equilateral triangle, except not a triangle <em>per se</em>, because the crust side is curvy. But it’s a similar idea. So, what angle should we cut this slice of pizza at, such that its crust length is the same as the length of the other two sides? (By “angle” we mean the angle at the center of the pizza, the one whose opposite side is the crust.)</p>
<p>Let’s think about this. Imagine this is a pizza with an <span class="math inline">\(18\)</span>-inch diameter. Then it has a radius of <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> inches, and then we know the total length of its crust (measured on the outside) is <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\cdot9 = 18\pi\)</span>. We also know—and we’ll slip back into degrees for a moment here, but I assure you it’s in service of a greater good—that the total number of degrees in this pizza is <span class="math inline">\(360\degree\)</span>. So we can think of this like a proportion: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\text{total crust length}}{\quad \text{total degrees in pizza} \quad} = \frac{\quad \text{crust length of our slice} \quad}{\text{degrees in our slice}}\]</span> We want the length of the crust to be equal to the length of the other two sides. But because the pizza slice is just a slice of a circle, the other two sides must be both <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> inches long: <img src="pizza-with-angle-question.svg" style="width:75.0%" /> So if we plug in all that stuff, our proportion looks like this: <span class="math display">\[\frac{18\pi \,\, \text{inches}}{360\degree} \quad=\quad \frac{9\,\, \text{inches}}{\text{degrees in our slice}}\]</span> Then it is easy to solve this and find out how many degrees there are in our equilateral slice of pizza: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(\text{degrees in our slice})\cdot \frac{18\pi}{360\degree} &amp;= 9\,\, \text{inches} \\ \\
\text{degrees in our slice} &amp;= \frac{9\,\, \text{inches} \cdot 360\degree}{18\pi \,\, \text{inches}} \\ \\
\text{degrees in our slice} &amp;\approx 57.296\degree 
\end{align*}\]</span> So then if we want a beautiful, equilateral slice of pizza, in which all the sides are the same length, we should cut it at an angle of <span class="math inline">\(57.296\degree\)</span>!!! Note that there’s something interesting here: even though we started with a pizza of radius <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> inches, that got cancelled out in our calculations. For <em>any</em> size pizza, an angle of <span class="math inline">\(57.296\degree\)</span> will give us an equilateral slice.</p>
<p>This all relates back to thinking about how to measure angles. Namely: this is the system of angle-measurement that we will use. We’ll create a measurement system in which the base unit is not <span class="math inline">\(360\degree\)</span> in a full revolution, or <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span>, but rather, in which the base unit of measurement represents the angle needed to make the opposite arc of a circle equal to the length of its radius. We’ll call it a <strong>radian</strong>:</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="width:75%; padding:1em;">
<p>1 radian <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> the angle needed to make all three sides of a slice of pizza the same length</p>
<p><img src="radian.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>That’s way of defining angles that is <em>natural to math</em>. It doesn’t rely on something like the human-chosen number <span class="math inline">\(360\)</span>. It’s a way of <em>talking about math using math</em>.</p>
<p>It should make sense that a radian is approximately <span class="math inline">\(57.296\degree\)</span>. We know that an equilateral triangle has angles of <span class="math inline">\(60\degree\)</span>, and an equilateral pizza slice isn’t quite the same thing—because of the curvy sides—but it is pretty close. So it makes sense that its angles should be close to <span class="math inline">\(60\degree\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we want to convert from degrees to radians (you would, of course, never want to convert out of radians!), we can simply derive a unit conversion factor. We know that the total number of radians in a full circle must be <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>, since that’s how many times we can fit the radius of a circle around its circumference. (We would have a pizza whose crust-length was <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> times that of its slice-radius.) Likewise, we know that the total number of degrees in a full circle is <span class="math inline">\(360\)</span>. So we must have <span class="math inline">\(360\degree\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> radians.</p>
<p>So, for example, if we want to convert <span class="math inline">\(75\degree\)</span> to radians: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{75 \,\, \text{degrees}}{1} \right)\left(\frac{2\pi \,\, \text{radians}}{360 \,\, \text{degrees}} \right) &amp;= \left(\frac{75 \,\, \cancel{\text{degrees}}}{1} \right)\left(\frac{2\pi \,\, \text{radians}}{360 \,\, \cancel{\text{degrees}}} \right) \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{150\pi}{360} \,\, \text{radians} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{5\pi}{12} \, \text{radians}
\end{align*}\]</span> The only sad thing about cutting our pizza in slices of one radian is that we’ll end up with exactly <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> slices—and that’s not an even number of slices! (Or rather, it’s not an <em>integer</em> number of slices.) <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> is about <span class="math inline">\(6.283\)</span>, so we’ll have <span class="math inline">\(0.283\)</span> pieces of pizza left!</p>
