<h1 class="title">Trig Word Problems!!!!</h1>
</header>
<p>Here are a bunch of word problems involving trig. Do them. Convert angles to radians when appropriate. Leave your answers in fully-written-out form as far as you can; if you are desperate for a decimal answer, wait until the last step before you plug things into your calculator. (And if you do that, be sure your calculator is in the correct mode (radians or degrees).)</p>
<p>Note that a lot of these problems use the phrases <strong>angle of elevation</strong> and <strong>angle of depression.</strong> From the context of the problems I think it’s clear what these mean, but here’s a visual explanation:</p>
<p><img src="angle-of-elevation.svg" style="display:inline;width:45%" /><img src="angle-of-depression.svg" style="display:inline;width:45%" /></p>
<p>And… I need to redraw all of these old bad pictures, as I’m sure you can tell, but I’m out of time! Tragic.</p>

<p>You are sitting in your apartment in Brooklyn late one night, staring out the window. You see a streetlight. The angle of depression to the top of the streetlight is <span class="math inline">\(55\degree\)</span>, and the angle of depression to the base of the streetlight is <span class="math inline">\(57.8\degree\)</span>.

<p>In aerial navigation, directions are given in degrees clockwise from north, called <strong>headings</strong>. So due east is <span class="math inline">\(90\degree\)</span>, due south is <span class="math inline">\(180\degree\)</span>, due west is <span class="math inline">\(270\degree\)</span>, etc.</p>

<p>You walk across the shown-below pedestrian overpass. As you step onto it, your sweater snags on the bridge. Unaware, you continue walking, and it begins to unravel. When you disembark at the opposite side of the bridge, how many feet of yarn have unravelled from your sweater? (Assume, however unrealistically, that the yarn doesn’t stretch, and is lying on the bottom of the bridge.)</p>

Your grandfather dies and leaves you his <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>-foot-tall clock. It has a base (and top) that’s about <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> feet square. Your apartment has <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>-foot, two-inch ceilings. But the door to your apartment is only <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> feet tall. Will you be able to use the grandfather clock as an interior decoration?
</li>
<li>
More generally: imagine you have a grandfather clock <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> units tall and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> units wide, a ceiling <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> units high, and a door less than <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> units tall. When will you be able to fit it into your apartment?

On a foggy night in San Francisco, you set off in your jetski at 9:30 PM, zipping across San Francisco Bay at <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span>mph on a heading of <span class="math inline">\(105\degree\)</span>. Simultaneously, your friend Lee leaves from a marina in Oakland due east of your marina in SF, traveling at a heading of <span class="math inline">\(195\degree\)</span>. Later, other boaters will tell police that they heard screams and saw a large fireball in the Bay. What happened? When? What was Lee’s average speed before the crash?

Somewhere in Canada’s frozen north, a poacher is setting a trap for a polar bear. Unbeknownst to him, a polar bear has noticed, and is running toward the poacher to teach him a lesson in Arctic ethics. The poacher’s friend, watching in horror, tries to warn the poacher, but they’re a half-mile apart, and the poacher can’t hear his friend shouting for him to turn around. The friend, meanwhile, has a compass with him, and observes that over a thirty-second period, the angle between the two friends and the bear (i.e., the angle given by poacher–friend–bear) decreases from <span class="math inline">\(\pi/3\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\pi/4\)</span>. (You can assume that the polar bear is running on a course perpendicular to the line between the two friends, i.e., that the angle friend–poacher–bear is a right angle.) When will the polar bear reach the poacher? (Be sure to give proper units.)

<p>Imagine a rectangle of width <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span> inscribed in an isosceles right triangle with a hypotenuse <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> units long:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Express the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate of the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
</li>
<li>
Come up for a function for the area of the rectangle in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Imagine you wanted to find the area of the largest possible rectangle that can fit inside the triangle. How would you do it?

<li>
You want to make an open-topped rectangular box by taking an <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>-by-<span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>in piece of cardboard, cutting squares out from the corners, and folding up the sides. Come up with an equation for the volume of said box, if each square you cut out is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> inches long. What if you wanted to make the biggest box you can make? What would its dimensions be? How would you figure out?

At 7 AM, Ship A is <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> miles due east of Ship B. Ship A had been sailing west at <span class="math inline">\(20mph\)</span> and Ship B had been sailing southeast at <span class="math inline">\(30mph\)</span>. Come up with a function for the distance between the two ships as a function of time. When are the two ships closest together?
</li>
<li>
A fence <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> feet high runs parallel to a tall building and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> feet away from it. Find the length of the shortest ladder that will reach from the ground across the top of the fence to the wall of the building. (Suggestion: come up with a function for the length of such a ladder as a function of its angle of elevation.)
</li>
<li>
Determine the point(s) on the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^2 + 1\)</span> that are closest to the point <span class="math inline">\((0,2)\)</span>. (Suggestion: Draw a picture. Then come up for the a function for the distance between the point <span class="math inline">\((0,2)\)</span> and some arbitrary point on the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. When will that function be smallest?)

<p>You are a lifeguard at the municipal beach in Churchill, Manitoba. One day, as you are sitting on your lifeguard chair next to Hudson Bay, you see a swimmer being attacked by a polar bear. The swimmer appears to be roughly 120 yards out to sea (on a straight line between the swimmer and the shore), and the lifeguard station is roughly 300 yards down the beach from the nearest point on shore to the swimmer. You can run at 13 yards per minute along the beach, and you can swim at 5 yards per minute. You want to get to the swimmer in the shortest amount of time, but you know that if you swim directly to him/her, it will take longer (since you can’t swim very fast), and you know that if you run all the way down the beach, it’ll take longer (since you’ll have to travel a longer distance). Given that you want to reach the swimmer as quickly as possible, how far down the beach do you run, and how far do you swim?</p>
Suggestion: if you run <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> yards down the beach, how far do you swim (in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>)? how long will it take you to get to the swimmer (in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>)? how can you find where this function has a minimum?
