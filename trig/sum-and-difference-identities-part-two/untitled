Jaxon, it's been such a joy being in multivariable calculus with you this semester. You're a passionate, energetic, and curious mathematician, and you've brought so much positive masculine energy to our unique class this semester. I've loved watching you and Cullen have passionate arguments about mathematics. ("I just watched a bunch of 17-year-old boys screaming at each other about linear algebra," is how I once reported it to colleagues.)
