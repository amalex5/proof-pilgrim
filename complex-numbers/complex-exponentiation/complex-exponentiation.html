<p>What’s <span class="math inline">\(i^i\)</span>? Can we even figure it out? Is it even a complex number? Or is it possibly something even more complex than the complex numbers? Does raising a complex number to another complex number wormhole us out into an even more bizarre realm of numbers?</p>
<p>Here’s the answer: it doesn’t. In fact, here’s the really weird thing: it actually wormholes us into a <em>simpler</em> realm of numbers. <span class="math inline">\(i^i\)</span> <em>is in fact a real number</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[i^i \approx 0.20787\dots\]</span></p>
<p>That’s a <em>totally ordinary and boring and bland number</em>—yet one that arises from the complicated combination of two very strange numbers! That itself is kind of wacky.</p>
<p>Just kidding. I lied. <span class="math inline">\(i^i\)</span> is indeed <span class="math inline">\(0.20787ish\)</span>, but it’s not <em>just</em> that. Actually, it’s an infinite number of things:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
i^i = \big\{ &amp;0.2078795763507619\dots,\\
&amp;0.0003882032039267\dots,\\
&amp;0.0000000724947252\dots,\\
&amp;0.0000000001353797\dots,\\
&amp;\quad\quad\vdots
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Whoah. <em>That’s</em> weird.</p>
<p>Wait, I lied again. There are some big ones, too:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;\quad\quad\vdots\\
&amp;31,920,519.1574213\dots,\\
&amp;59,609.74149287215\dots,\\
&amp;111.31777848985622\dots,\\
i^i =\quad &amp;0.2078795763507619\dots,\\
&amp;0.0003882032039267\dots,\\
&amp;0.0000000724947252\dots,\\
&amp;0.0000000001353797\dots,\\
&amp;\quad\quad\vdots
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>There are an infinite number of <span class="math inline">\(i^i\)</span>s!!!! They can’t be <em>any</em> number—it’s not random—there <em>is</em> some order—but what is the order? What’s the fundamental logic here? Why is <span class="math inline">\(i^i\)</span> not only a bizarrely-normal real number, but also an infinite number of them?</p>
<p>The tricky thing is that, unlike with normal exponentiation, we can’t just multiply <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> by itself <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> times:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[i^i = \underbrace{i\cdot i\cdot i\cdot i\cdots}_{i\text{ times}}\]</span></p>
<p>What does that even mean??? How do we count to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>? Rather than resolve that question, we’ll use a different strategy. We know that we can write any number on the unit circle as <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\theta}\)</span>. And we know that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is on the unit circle, with an angle of <span class="math inline">\(\pi/2\)</span>. So then we can write <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[i = e^{i\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a little unsatisfying, since we have <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> on both sides, but that doesn’t make the equation any less true. But then what happens if we raise both sides to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>? We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
i^i &amp;= \left(e^{i\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}}\right)^i \\
&amp;= e^{\left(i\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\cdot i} \quad\quad\text{(exponent rules)}\\
&amp;= e^{i^2\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}} \\
&amp;= e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} \quad\quad(i^2=-1)\\
&amp;\approx 0.20787957635\dots
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>So we’ve found <span class="math inline">\(i^i\)</span>! It’s just some boring ol’ real number! What a letdown. (Alternatively, perhaps the fact that from a combination of strange numbers we get such a pedestrian number is itself interesting!)</p>
<p>Of course, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> isn’t just <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\pi/2}\)</span>. It’s also <span class="math inline">\(e^{5i\pi/2}\)</span>. And <span class="math inline">\(e^{9i\pi/2}\)</span>. And so forth. We can add or subtract <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> from the angle, and we’ve found another way to write <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;\quad\quad\vdots\\
&amp;e^{-11i\pi/2},\\
&amp;e^{-7i\pi/2},\\
&amp;e^{-3i\pi/2},\\
i =\quad &amp;e^{i\pi/2},\\
&amp;e^{5i\pi/2},\\
&amp;e^{-9i\pi/2},\\
&amp;\quad\quad\vdots
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Usually we don’t worry too much about these extra multiples of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>. But now, they actually matter! Raising everything to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;\quad\quad\vdots&amp;\vdots \quad\quad&amp;&amp;\vdots\quad &amp;&amp;\vdots\quad\quad\\
&amp;\left(e^{-11i\pi/2}\right)^i, &amp;e^{-i^2\cdot11\pi/2},    &amp;&amp;e^{11\pi/2},&amp;&amp;  31,920,519.1\dots,\\
&amp;\left(e^{-7i\pi/2}\right)^i, &amp;e^{-i^2\cdot7\pi/2},&amp;&amp;e^{7\pi/2},  &amp;&amp;59,609.74149\dots,\\
&amp;\left(e^{-3i\pi/2}\right)^i,&amp;e^{-i^2\cdot3\pi/2},&amp;&amp;e^{3\pi/2},  &amp;&amp;  111.31777849\dots, \\
i^i =\quad &amp;\left(e^{i\pi/2}\right)^i, \quad\quad=&amp;e^{i^2\cdot\pi/2}, &amp;&amp;=\quad e^{-\pi/2}, &amp;&amp;\approx \quad 0.2078795763\dots, \\
&amp;\left(e^{5i\pi/2}\right)^i, &amp; e^{i^2\cdot5\pi/2},&amp;&amp;e^{-5\pi/2},  &amp;&amp;  0.0003882032\dots,  \\
&amp;\left(e^{9i\pi/2}\right)^i, &amp;e^{i^2\cdot9\pi/2},&amp;&amp;e^{-9\pi/2},  &amp;&amp;  0.0000000724\dots,  \\
&amp;\quad\quad\vdots&amp;\vdots \quad\quad&amp;&amp;\vdots\quad &amp;&amp;\vdots\quad\quad\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>So all these multiples of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> actually do matter! We get an infinite number of values of <span class="math inline">\(i^i\)</span>, each of them a multiple of the previous one by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(e^{2\pi}\)</span>. We could write it a bit more concisely:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
i^i &amp;= \left(e^{i\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi \right)}\right)^i,\quad\text{for }k\in\mathbb{Z}\\ 
&amp;= e^{-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi \right)} \\
&amp;= e^{\frac{\pi}{2}(4k+3)}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is any integer, then multiplying it by <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> and then adding <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> will get us the coefficients we want—all the numbers which are <span class="math inline">\(3\mod4\)</span>, i.e., whose remainder when divided by <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="any-complex-number-to-any-other-complex-number">Any complex number to any other complex number??</h2>
<p>Here’s the more general question: how do we raise numbers to complex powers? We’ve spent a lot of time raising complex <em>bases</em> to real powers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(1+2i)^4,\quad\quad\left(7e^{i\pi/6}\right)^{1/3}, \quad\quad\text{etc.}\]</span></p>
<p>But what if the <em>power</em> is complex? What if we have some arbitrary complex number and we want to raise it to some other arbitrary complex number? Suppose we have two complex numbers, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, with radii <span class="math inline">\(r_z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_w\)</span> and angles <span class="math inline">\(\theta_z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_w\)</span>, respectively:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[z = r_ze^{i\theta_z}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[w = r_we^{i\theta_w}\]</span></p>
<p>Can we raise them to each other? What do we get?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[z^w = \left( r_ze^{i\theta_z}\right)^{\left(r_we^{i\theta_w}\right)} =\quad ???\]</span></p>
<p>Maybe if we write each complex number in the right form, it’ll be clearer how to compute it?? Hmm. Let’s return to this.</p>
<h2 id="imaginary-roots-sqrtii">Imaginary roots?? <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[i]{i}\)</span>??</h2>
<p>Imaginary exponents!!!! What about <em>imaginary roots</em>?? Roots are just exponents! Can we take the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’th root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>? Sure!!! We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt[i]{i} = (i)^{1/i}\]</span></p>
<p>But we know that <span class="math inline">\(1/i\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(-i\)</span>. We could figure this out by thinking about the cycles of the powers of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(i^{-1}\)</span> has to be the same as <span class="math inline">\(i^3\)</span>. Or we could figure it out by multiplying by the conjugate. So this becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\sqrt[i]{i}  &amp;= (i)^{1/i}\\
&amp;= (i)^{-i}\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{i^i}  \quad\text{(properties of exponents)}\\
\text{but we just figured out that } i^i = e^{-\pi/2}\text{, so this is:}\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{e^{-\pi/2}} \\
&amp;\text{which, by properties of exponents, is:}\\
&amp;= e^{\pi/2}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>So we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt[i]{i} = e^{\pi/2}\]</span></p>
<p>What does this even <em>mean</em>?? It means that if we multiply <span class="math inline">\(e^{\pi/2}\)</span> by itself <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> times, we get <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. But what does it—what does—what does “multiply something <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> times” even <em>mean</em>?!?!? Can you count to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> on your fingers??? Is the reason we can’t count to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> on our fingers because we haven’t yet evolved to do so, or is there a fundamental reason preventing us?</p>
<p>By the way, just like before, is this the only value of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[i]{i}\)</span>? Or are there others? I’ll ask you to figure that out in a homework problem.</p>
<h2 id="imaginary-exponents-with-real-bases-2i">Imaginary exponents, with real bases?? <span class="math inline">\(2^i\)</span>??</h2>
<p>What about something like <span class="math inline">\(2^i\)</span>? With <span class="math inline">\(2^i\)</span>, we’ve got a real base, and an imaginary exponent. Like before, this is “very easy” because we “just” “multiply” two by itself “<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> times:”</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i = \underbrace{2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdots}_{i\text{ times}}\]</span></p>
<p>Just kidding! That still doesn’t make any sense. Maybe like before, we can find a clever way to rewrite <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> so that the algebra is tractable. Let’s try writing <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> in polar/exponential/Euler/<span class="math inline">\(e^{i\theta}\)</span> form, and see what happens. The radius is <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and the angle is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, so we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2\cdot e^{i\cdot0}\]</span></p>
<p>So then, if we raise it to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(2\cdot e^{i\cdot0}\right)^i\]</span></p>
<p>So, if we distribute the outer <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> exponent, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i\cdot e^{i^2\cdot0}\]</span></p>
<p>But actually this is all totally pointless, because we’ve got that zero in the exponent, so <span class="math inline">\(e^{i^2\cdot0} = e^0 = 1\)</span>. So this all just becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i\cdot1\]</span></p>
<p>So we’re back where we started. Darn. We need a different idea. Here’s one: remember back when we were talking about logarithms, and how we started a bunch of log proofs by rewriting some arbitrary number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(e^{\ln x}\)</span>? It was a way of rewriting things that seemed silly and tautological, but turned out to be useful (like “adding zero” in a clever way, or “multiplying by one” in a clever way). This way is useful here, too. We can rewrite <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2 = e^{\ln 2}\]</span></p>
<p>Then, raising it to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i = \left(e^{\ln2}\right)^i\]</span></p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i = e^{i\ln2}\]</span></p>
<p>But the right side, then, is <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> raised to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> times something—so it’s now in polar/exponential/Euler form!!! The right side is a complex number with radius <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and angle <span class="math inline">\(\ln2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i = e^{i\ln2}=1\angle \ln2\]</span></p>
<p>The angle being <span class="math inline">\(\ln2\)</span> is weird. We think of <span class="math inline">\(\ln2\)</span> as being just a number, and not an angle. Our internal type-checker should be going off:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;..Traceback (most recent call last):
.....File &quot;3.math.nueva&quot;, line i, in &lt;complex-numbers&gt;
.....TypeError: polar form takes &quot;angle&quot; as input, not &quot;natural logarithm&quot;</code></pre>
<p>But hey, angles are also numbers! So <span class="math inline">\(\ln2\)</span> certainly can be an angle. What are the units? Radians! Using a calculator we can find that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ln(2) \approx .6931\dots\]</span></p>
<p>So it’s about <span class="math inline">\(70\%\)</span> of a radian. A radian is about <span class="math inline">\(57^\circ\)</span>. Let’s actually compute this in degrees so we have some intuition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\ln(2) \text{ radians}}{\pi/180 \text{ radians per degree}} \approx 39\text{ish degrees}\]</span></p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i = e^{i\ln2}=1\angle 39^\circ\text{ish}\]</span></p>
<p>If we wanted to write it in rectangular, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^i = e^{i\ln2} = \underbrace{\cos(\ln2)}_{.769\text{ish}} + \, i\underbrace{\sin(\ln2)}_{.639\text{ish}}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>Your teachers have been lying to you all your lives: not only are numbers in fact two-dimensional, but also <em>functions can in fact have multiple values</em>. That’s what we’re seeing now.</p>
<p>You’ve known for years that square roots have two values. When we’re younger, that gets shoved behind the curtain. “Oh, we only care about the <em>positive</em> root! Don’t worry about the negative one!” We’ve been discovering recently that not only do square roots have two values, but cube roots have three values, quartic roots have four values, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th roots have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> values. And now, what we’re seeing is that if we raise things to imaginary powers, we have an infinite number of values.</p>
<p>Square roots are fundamentally multi-valued. Actually, <em>most</em> things are fundamentally multi-valued. The real-numbered world we inhabit is only a slice through that—a particular slice of reality in which most things only have one value. But sometimes we see cracks in that reality. Square roots are an example of that. So are inverse trig functions. (They’re infinite-valued.) Complex numbers lead us to the deeper reality: the world is fundamentally multi-valued.</p>

<li>
<p>Now that we’ve done all this, we have a very solid handle on exponentiation with complex numbers! We can raise any complex base to any complex exponent—hooray! But what about exponentiation’s <s>evil</s> awesome twin, logarithmancy? Can we take logarithms of complex numbers? Can we take complex-based logarithms of complex numbers? Like, for example, what is: <span class="math display">\[\log_{\left(r_1e^{i\theta_1}\right)}\left(r_2e^{i\theta_2}\right) = \quad???\]</span> Yikes. If we want to get a handle on that, we’d better start with something simpler. What about just taking a normal ol’ natural log of a complex number? Natural logarithms, remember, are just logarithms with our old friend, <span class="math inline">\(e\approx 2.7182\dots\)</span>, who is a real number, as the base. But what if their argument (the thing we’re taking the log of) is complex?</p>
For example, suppose <span class="math inline">\(z=5e^{i\pi/4}\)</span>. What’s <span class="math inline">\(\ln(z)\)</span>? Is there only one solution? Is there a multitude of them? An infinitude? Can you come up with a general formula for the natural log of any complex number? Can you then generalize to the logarithm with any real base of any complex number?
