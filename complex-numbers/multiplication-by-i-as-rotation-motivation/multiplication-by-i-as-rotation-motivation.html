<h1 class="title">Let’s Multiply Things By <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>!</h1>
</header>
<p>Some problems to do, right now, on a separate sheet of paper:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Take the complex number <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. (Yes, it’s a real number, but it’s also a complex number.) Graph it on the complex plane. Then…
<ol class='lettered-list'>
<li>
Multiply it by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. What do you get? Graph it (on the same axes).
<li>
Multiply <em>that</em> by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. (In other words, compute <span class="math inline">\((7\cdot i)\cdot i)\)</span>. Again, show it algebraically (i.e., as a mathy expression) and visually (i.e., graph it, on the same axes).
<li>
Multiply it by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> a third time, and again, show that result symbolically and visually.
<li>
Do it a fourth time.
<li>
Do it a fifth time.
<li>
Do it a sixth time.
<li>
What if you did it <span class="math inline">\(793\)</span> times? What would the result be (both symbolically and visually)? Do you have to do all <span class="math inline">\(792\)</span> antecedent calculations, or is there an easier way?
</ol>
<li>
Now do the same thing(s) as in the previous problem, but with the following numbers:
<ol class='lettered-list'>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(6i\)</span>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(3+2i\)</span>
<li>
your favorite real number
<li>
your favorite imaginary number
<li>
your favorite non-real, non-imaginary complex number (i.e., a complex number that has both real and imaginary parts that aren’t <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>).
</ol>
<li>
Now (and this is the <strong>WHOLE POINT</strong>), make a conjecture: what happens, <em>visually/geometrically</em>, when we multiply a number by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>? (VERY IMPORTANT! ALL THOSE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS WERE LEADING UP TO THAT!!! THIS IS MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE WILL LEARN THIS MONTH!!!!!) (Maybe you already know it? Maybe you did it last year and remember?!? No matter!)
<li>
What about when we multiply a number by <span class="math inline">\(i^2\)</span>? by <span class="math inline">\(i^3\)</span>? by <span class="math inline">\(i^4\)</span>? by <span class="math inline">\(i^5\)</span>?
<li>
What about when we multiply a number by <span class="math inline">\(i^{0.5}\)</span>? What about when we multiply a number by <span class="math inline">\(i^{1.7}\)</span>? Guess!
<li>
Verify one of your guesses from the previous part. In class, we worked out that: <span class="math display">\[\sqrt{i}=i^{0.5} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i\]</span> Take the number <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>, and multiply it by this. Plot the result. Then multiply the result by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i\)</span> again, and plot it. Again! Again!
<li>
What about when we <em>divide</em> a number by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>? If you’re unsure about this, here are some things to try slash think about:
<ul>
<li>
Try repeating all the same subproblems as in the first problem, but with division instead of multiplication. What happens?
<li>
Division and multiplication—how are they related?
<li>
Suppose you have the complex number <span class="math inline">\(7\cdot i^3\)</span>. Where is it on the complex plane? If you divide off an <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, to get <span class="math inline">\(7i^2\)</span>, where is it? What if you divide off another <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>?
</ul>
<li>
What if we multiply a number by a number that’s not just a pure power of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>?
<ol class='lettered-list'>
<li>
For example, what if we multiply <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(2i\)</span>? What do we get, symbolically and visually? How does the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> change things from just multiplying it by pure <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>? What if we do that again? In other words, what is <span class="math inline">\(5\cdot(2i)\cdot2i\)</span>, symbolically and visually? What if we multiply <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(2i\)</span> three times? Four times? <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times?
<li>
Likewise, what if we multiply <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(3+i\)</span>? What do we get, symbolically and visually? What if we multiply it by <span class="math inline">\(3+i\)</span> twice (i.e., compute <span class="math inline">\(5\cdot(3+i)(3+i)\)</span>, and then plot it on the complex plane)? What about three times (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(5\cdot(3+i)(3+i)(3+i)\)</span>? Four times? Five times? Do you really want to keep working that out? Why or why not? Is this frustrating? Is there a better way? Do you see a pattern?
<li>
Here’s the most general question: if we multiply the number <span class="math inline">\(z_1=a+bi\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(z_2=c+di\)</span>, what does that mean, visually and geometrically?
