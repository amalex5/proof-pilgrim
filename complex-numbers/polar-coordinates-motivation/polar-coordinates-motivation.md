Some problems to do, right now, on a separate sheet of paper:

<ol class='problems'>
<li> On the complex axes, plot the following points:
<ol class="lettered-list">
<li> $i^0$
<li> $\sqrt{i}$ a/k/a $i^{1/2}$ (We figured out in class what this is! Remember, just like with all other square roots, there are *two* of them.)
<li> $i$
<li> $i^2$
<li> $i^3$
<li> $i^4$
</ol>

<li> As we're plotting $i^k$, where $k$ is starting at $0$, going up through $1/2$, to $2$, $3$, $4$, etc., what's happening?

<li> Any guesses as to where $\sqrt[3]{i}$ a/k/a $i^{1/3}$ might go on these axes? (I guess you already figured out, on a different worksheet and in your lovely writeups, what $\sqrt[3]{i}$ is. Plot it anyway. Any patterns you see?)

<li> Plot $\displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i$

<li> Plot $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$

<li> Plot $\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{2\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2\sqrt{2}}\cdot i$

<li> What power do you think you have to raise $i$ to to get $\displaystyle-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i$? (You can probably find one power pretty easily. What's another power? A third?)

<li> What power do you think you have to raise $i$ to to get $\displaystyle-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i$? (Again, can you find multiple powers that work?)

<li> What if you wanted to make a power of $i$ that gives you $\displaystyle-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}i$? What power would that need to be? In other words, what's the solution to:
$$i^{?????} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}i$$
(Once you find one solution---is that the only one? Are there any others? How many are there?)

<li> Consider these two complex numbers:
\begin{align*}
z_1 &= \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{2\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2\sqrt{2}}\cdot i \\ \\
z_2 &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i
\end{align*}
You should already have drawn them on your complex plane, but if your current complex plane is getting messy, draw them on a new one. Then, multiply them together. Plot the result. What do you notice? 

(If you weren't in my Math 3 section last semester, ask someone who was if there's anything interesting about the number(s) $\displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{3}\pm1}{2\sqrt{2}}$.)

<li> Now consider these two complex numbers:
\begin{align*}
z_1 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\ \\
z_2 &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i
\end{align*}
Again, plot them on a new set of complex axes. Then multiply them together, and plot the result. Any observations? 

<li> Here's another pair of complex numbers.
$$z_1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\quad\quad z_2 =  \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{2\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2\sqrt{2}}\cdot i$$
Divide them $(z_1/z_2)$. What do you get? Is it familiar?

<li> Suppose I ask you to multiply together the following complex numbers:

$$\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right)\cdot \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \right)\cdot \left( -i \right)\cdot \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right)\cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{2\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2\sqrt{2}} i \right)$$
<ol class="lettered-list">
<li> Do you want to multiply all of these out by hand?
<li> Do you have any better ideas?
<li> Are you lazy? Can you figure out a faster way? 
<li> Don't just "suppose" that I asked you to multiply those numbers together---actually multiply them together. What do you get?
</ol>

<li> Suppose you have a fractional power of $i$, like $i^{3.2}$ or $i^{12/11}$, where the exponent isn't an integer. Is the resulting number purely imaginary, purely real, or non-real non-imaginary complex? Why or why not?

<li> Think back to the problem we did last week where we found all six sixth roots of $64$.
<ol class="lettered-list">
<li> One of the roots of $64$ we found was $1+i\sqrt{3}$. Can you multiply that by itself six times, and plot the result of each successive multiplication? In other words, plot:
$$\left(1+i\sqrt{3}\right), \left(1+i\sqrt{3}\right)^2, \left(1+i\sqrt{3}\right)^3, \left(1+i\sqrt{3}\right)^4, \left(1+i\sqrt{3}\right)^5, \left(1+i\sqrt{3}\right)^6$$
You may as well plot $\left(1+i\sqrt{3}\right)^0$, too. What happens? Describe.
<li> Is this the same (conceptually, more or less) as all the previous problems on this worksheet? If not, how is it different?
<li> All of this multiplication is so unpleasant. Is there a pattern that would let us plot all six of those points above without having to do so much tedious binomial expansion???
<li> What happens if we repeat this same process with each of the other five sixth roots of $64$? Does the graph look the same, or different? How?
</ol>
