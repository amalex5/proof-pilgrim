<p><em>these are the example formulas for complex roots that some of the kids in Math 3 Spring 2022 came up with and that I excerpted for that year’s set of notes</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Of course, many of you already know this, since you managed to figure it out yourselves in class! Since there are so many ways to write this formula—so many ways to describe this/these numbers—I want to show some examples.</p>
<p>Some of you wrote all the roots as a long list, like Landon X.:</p>
<p><img src="roots-of-all-complex-numbers-s2022-landon-xu.png" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>Landon’s brother, like many of you, decided not to write a long list, and instead create a new variable to describe all the roots more succinctly:</p>
<p><img src="roots-of-all-complex-numbers-s2022-logan-xu.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Some of you made analogies to coding and the counters/indices in <code>for</code>-loops! That’s exactly what we need here—a counter to describe each of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>’th roots as we rotate around the complex plane.</p>
<p>In Block 4, a bunch of you decided to write it in terms of its rectangular form (i.e., in terms of its real and imaginary parts). Here’s a representative example, from Charlotte R.:</p>
<p><img src="roots-of-all-complex-numbers-s2022-charlotte-rosario.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Note how you’re all using different letters to represent different things in all these forms. For instance, in Landon’s version of the formula, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the number we’re taking the roots of; in Logan’s, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the counter. Logan used <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to represent the radius and angle; Charlotte used them to represent the real and imaginary parts. All of those are perfectly valid choices, but they do make it harder to quickly read and scan.</p>
<p>Here’s how a big group of you in Block 8 wrote it (credit for this particular version to Sam Z.):</p>
<p><img src="roots-of-all-complex-numbers-s2022-sam-zukin.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>Kate K. was reminded of all the <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=modular+arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a></strong> she’s learned in Jana’s cryptology class this semester, and decided to write it using that language. Here’s how she wrote the roots of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (as opposed to the roots of any complex number) using those ideas:</p>
<p><img src="roots-of-all-complex-numbers-s2022-kate-kuan.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Her fundamental idea, as she told me, was that the angles are all mod <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>. That’s an excellent insight—and exactly the way to think about the relationship between angles and positions.</p>
