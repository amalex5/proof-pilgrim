<p><strong>You cannot take the square root of a negative number.</strong> Imagine you want to find the square root of <span class="math inline">\(-25\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt{-25} = \,\, ???\]</span></p>
<p>It can’t be <span class="math inline">\(-5\)</span>, because a negative times a negative is a positive; negative five times negative five is positive <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(-5)\cdot(-5) = +25\]</span></p>
<p>It can’t be <span class="math inline">\(+5\)</span>, because then where would the negative come from? <span class="math display">\[(+5)\cdot(+5) = +25\]</span></p>
<p>So you cannot take the square root of a negative number.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>But…</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><em>What if you could???</em></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>We’re about to start talking about complex numbers.</strong> The complex numbers are what arise when you say, sure, you can take the square root of a negative number; it’s just a new sort of number, which we denote by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sqrt{-1} = i \]</span></p>
<p>Any other negative square root we can just write in terms of this imaginary made-up new number:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sqrt{-25} = \sqrt{25\cdot(-1)} = \sqrt{25}\cdot\sqrt{-1} = 5\sqrt{-1} = 5i \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sqrt{-2} = \sqrt{2\cdot(-1)} = \sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{-1} \approx (1.4142\dots )\sqrt{-1} \approx (1.4142\dots )i \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{etc} \]</span></p>
<p>This is very exciting: the theory of complex numbers rivals calculus as the most intellectually profound thing we can do in high school.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>You’ve probably dealt with complex numbers somewhat in Math 2 and previous classes. We’ll start at the beginning anyway. You haven’t all seen exactly the same stuff (or remember all the same stuff), and having strong foundations is the most important part of building huge skyscrapers. If you’re bored, don’t worry—you’ll see new stuff soon enough!</p>
<p>Actually, we won’t start totally at the beginning. I don’t think we’ll spend too much time justifying the existence of complex numbers, or motivating them. That’s too bad, because the motivation and justification behind complex numbers is really cool! But it’s also way harder to talk about. (In some sense, the most fundamental things are often the hardest.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> And I think most of you have done at least <em>some</em> of that in previous years. (Maybe I’ll give you some readings (by other people) or we’ll watch a video to that effect.)</p>
<p>Instead, we’ll start <em>in media res</em>. Is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> actually a valid mathematical object? Does <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> actually exist?!? For now, let’s just suspend our disbelief. Suspension of disbelief is an important skill in math as well as in literature. Refusing to read or disliking <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> because hobbits don’t exist misses the point. If the internal logic of a world creates contradictions, then by all means call them out. Otherwise: live by the internal logic, suspend your disbelief, and see what you can discover. That’s what we’ll do here. We’ll act like <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> is the most ordinary mathematical object in the world, and just play with it just like we would any other mathematical object. If the universe ends up exploding—well, then I guess we’ll learn that maybe we shouldn’t have suspended our disbelief. If the universe doesn’t appear to explode—then we’ve got a brand-new mathematical friend!</p>
<p>So we’ll just act all casual about the existence and reality of complex numbers. Nevertheless, every time you interact with a complex number in this class, there should still a voice somewhere in the back of your head screaming, “IS THIS ALL MADE UP??!! IS THIS ACTUALLY REAL?!?!” In fact, that voice in your head should be screaming that not just every time you use complex numbers, but also every time you use transcendental numbers (like <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>), irrational numbers, negative numbers, zero. How do you know that ANY of those numbers exist or make any sense as concepts?!? People way, way smarter than you and I spent <em>hundreds of years</em> arguing about those questions.</p>
<p>We must suspend our disbelief—but not fully.</p>
<h2 id="but-anyway">But Anyway</h2>
<p>Back to suspending our disbelief in the existence and objectivity of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Now that we have these new numbers, the complex numbers, we need to (re-)learn how to do math with them. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we do <strong>arithmetic</strong> with complex numbers? We’re pretty good at arithmetic with real numbers. What about with complex numbers?
<ul>
<li>How do we <strong>add</strong> and <strong>subtract</strong> complex numbers?</li>
<li>How do we <strong>multiply</strong> and <strong>divide</strong> complex numbers?</li>
<li>How do we takes <strong>powers</strong> and <strong>roots</strong> of complex numbers?</li>
<li>How do we <strong>exponentiate</strong> and <strong>logarithm…ate</strong> complex numbers?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>And we know a lot more math than just arithmetic! We’d also like to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we do <strong>algebra</strong> with complex numbers? How do <strong>functions</strong> of complex numbers work? What do they look like?</li>
<li>How do we do <strong>geometry</strong> with complex numbers?</li>
<li>How do we do <strong>calculus</strong> with complex numbers? (Well, I guess we should probably learn how to do calculus with real numbers first!)</li>
</ul>
<p>When we generalize and zoom out, things can get weird. We’ve already seen this: we played around with polynomials, which were very nice. Then we generalized to rational functions. Every polynomial is also a rational function, but there are plenty of rational functions that aren’t polynomials. (Rational functions are what we get if we allow the exponents to be negative!) And it turns out that if we zoom out to thinking about all rational functions, things can get pretty weird. We get asymptotes! (Both the horizontal and vertical kind!)</p>
<p>Similarly, <strong>do strange new things happen when we zoom out from the real numbers to the complex numbers?</strong> Which new uncontacted tribes do we, as mathematical anthropologists, discover and try to understand? T.S. Eliot writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home is where one starts from. As we grow older <br> The world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated … <br> (<em>East Coker</em>, 190-191)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, he wasn’t writing about math <em>per se</em>, but he might as well have been, since the poem continues, a few lines later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must be still and still moving <br> Into another intensity <br> For a further union, a deeper communion … (204-206)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us move into the intensity of the complex numbers, and in so doing have a deeper communion with mathematical reality.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-really-cool-thing-about-i">The First Really Cool Thing About <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span></h2>
<p>Well, maybe this is the <em>second</em> really cool thing about <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The first cool thing is that it exists at all! (Does it?) But this second really cool thing about <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is that if we multiply it by itself, a really cool pattern emerges.</p>
<p>We define <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as the square root of negative one. <em>But what happens when we square it</em>? By definition, squaring a square root destroys it. Squares and square roots cancel each other out. They’re inverses. So if we multiply <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span>, we just get <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. Put more mathematically:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
i^2 &amp;= i\cdot i \\
&amp;= \sqrt{-1}\cdot \sqrt{-1} \\
&amp;= -1\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>If this is confusing, think of what happens when we square other square roots:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{5} = 5 \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sqrt{374}\cdot\sqrt{374} = 374 \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sqrt{2x}\cdot\sqrt{2x} = 2x \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt{\text{your favorite number}}\,\cdot\,\sqrt{\text{your favorite number}} = \text{your favorite number} \]</span></p>
<p>So that’s what happens when we multiply <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> by itself. But what if we keep going, and keep multiplying the result, and keep raising <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to a successively higher power?</p>
<p>To start with, does <span class="math inline">\(i^3\)</span> work out to be anything nice? Well, <span class="math inline">\(i^3\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(i^2\)</span> times another <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, so this becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\begin{align*}
i^3 &amp;= \left(i^2\right)\cdot i \\
&amp;= (-1)\cdot i \\
&amp;= -i
\end{align*}
 \]</span></p>
<p>What about <span class="math inline">\(i^4\)</span>? Similar to before, <span class="math inline">\(i^4\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(i^3\)</span> times another <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, so we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\begin{align*}
i^4 &amp;= i^3 \cdot i\\
\text{but we just learned that }i^3=-i\text{, so this is:}\\
&amp;= (-i)\cdot i \\
&amp;= -i^2 \\
\text{but we also learned that }i^2=-1\text{, so this is:}\\
&amp;= -(-1)\\
&amp;= +1
\end{align*}
 \]</span></p>
<p>Let’s keep going! How about <span class="math inline">\(i^5\)</span>? We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot i = i  \]</span></p>
<p>More! More!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ i^6 = i^5 \cdot i = i\cdot i = i^2 = -1  \]</span> We could keep going—<em>but it’s repeating</em>! We took <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, multiplied it by itself, and we get this pattern that repeats every four multiplications. We start with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then get <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(-i\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, then back to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then back to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, and so on and so forth, <em>ad infinitum</em>!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\begin{align*}
i^{0} &amp;= +1 \\
i^{1} &amp;= +i \\
i^{2} &amp;= -1 \\
i^{3} &amp;= -i \\
i^{4} &amp;= +1 \\
i^{5} &amp;= +i \\
i^{6} &amp;= -1 \\
i^{7} &amp;= -i \\
i^{8} &amp;= +1 \\
i^{9} &amp;= +i \\
&amp;\vdots
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>It’s weird, because it’s like multiplying something by <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, <em>but even more so</em>. If we multiply things by <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> over and over again, we get a pattern that repeats every two iterations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(-1)^n = +1, -1, +1, -1, +1, \cdots \]</span></p>
<p>But if we multiply <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> by itself, over and over again, we get a pattern that repeats <em>every four iterations</em>! Wacky. Why <em>four</em>???</p>
<p>I guess if we squint, we can see the powers of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> repeating their parity (positive/negativeness) every two iterations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (i)^n = \underbrace{1, i}_{+},\, \underbrace{-1, -i}_{-},\, \underbrace{1, i}_{+},\, \underbrace{-1, -i}_{-},\,  \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>Likewise, they repeat their one-or-<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-ness every two iterations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ |i^n| = 1,i, 1, i, 1,i, \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>I guess we can summarize the pattern of powers of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> more concisely:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\begin{align*}
i^{(\text{a multiple of }4)} &amp;= +1 \\
i^{(\text{a multiple of }4) \,+\,1} &amp;= +i \\
i^{(\text{a multiple of }4)\,+\,2} &amp;= -1 \\
i^{(\text{a multiple of }4)\,+\,3} &amp;= -i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is cool! It’s kind of annoying to memorize though—we have to keep track of whether it’s <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and whether it’s <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>. That’s annoying! I wish there were a better way. Is there some underlying logic to the reason these four elements are in the order they’re in? In other words, why is the pattern this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \cdots, +i, -1, -i, +1, \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>And not this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \cdots, +i,-i,+1,-1, \cdots\quad???\]</span></p>
<p>or this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \cdots, +i,+1,-i,-1, \cdots\quad???\]</span></p>
<p>One answer is “because that’s what we got when we worked out the algebra,” but that doesn’t seem very <em>satisfying</em>. Is there a better reason? A deeper reason?</p>
<p>This is all <em>super cool</em> and I hope it’s inspiring us to want to discover even more about <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>! Clearly, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is a weird number, that behaves in ways that are unexpected and counterintuitive. Why? What other weird behaviors do complex numbers have?</p>
<h2 id="small-print-legalese">Small-Print Legalese</h2>
<p>OK, that header is a bit too dismissive. But like with any new mathematical topic, there’s some new vocabulary and notation that we should quickly get up to speed on. The vocabulary and the notation isn’t the <em>point</em>, but it is <em>antecedent</em> to the point. When you’re learning how to fly a plane, you need to learn how to adjust the fuel/oxygen mixture in the engine, and it’s not like anyone is particularly excited about that, or thinks that achieving the perfect mixture of fuel:oxygen for efficient combustion is why they love flying planes, but if you get it wrong, the engine stalls and you die.</p>
<p>Here’s the first thing to know: <em>there’s nothing imaginary about the imaginary numbers!</em> Here’s the second thing to know: <em>there’s nothing complex about the complex numbers!</em> Imaginary numbers aren’t any more “imaginary” than any other numbers (and the “real” numbers are no more or less real than them); complex numbers aren’t any more complicated than non-complex numbers (which are already very complicated and intricate and beautiful!<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Gauss supposedly proposed calling imaginary numbers <strong>lateral numbers</strong>, deliberately to get rid of the idea that they were “imaginary” (or at least more imaginary than real numbers, which he wanted to call <strong>direct numbers</strong>). I really like that, because it removes the value judgments slash other connotations associated with our vernacular definitions of “real,” “complex,” and “imaginary.”</p>
<p>An <strong>imaginary number</strong> is a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, that is, a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span>. Here are some imaginary numbers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{examples of imaginary numbers: } i,\, 5i,\, -2i,\, \pi i,\, \frac{i}{12}\]</span></p>
<p>A <strong>complex number</strong> is a twofer: a hybrid chimera with one real-numbered parent and one imaginary-numbered parent. It consists of two real numbers added together, with the second one multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. So any complex number <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> we can write as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[z = a + bi\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are both real numbers. <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the <strong>real component</strong> (or the <strong>real part</strong>) and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the <strong>imaginary component</strong> (or the <strong>imaginary part</strong>). Note that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is itself a real number—it’s the <em>coefficient</em> on the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> term, but it doesn’t include the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> itself. Here’s another way to put that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{a complex number} = (\underbrace{\text{a real number}}_{\text{real component}}) + (\underbrace{\text{another real number}}_{\text{imaginary component}})\cdot \underbrace{i}_{i}\]</span></p>
<p>As a practical matter, we tend to use the variables <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to denote complex numbers (and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to denote real numbers).</p>
<p>Here’s an observation: <em>every real number is also a complex number</em>. It’s just that real numbers have imaginary part of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. For example, we can think of the real number <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> as being also a complex number: it’s <span class="math inline">\(5+0i\)</span>. It has real part <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, and imaginary part <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. This is like how every integer is <em>also</em> a rational number: <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> is a rational number, because we can write it as the ratio of two integers, <span class="math inline">\(7/1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Likewise, every imaginary number is also a complex number: we can think of the imaginary number <span class="math inline">\(7i\)</span> as being <span class="math inline">\(0+7i\)</span>, so it has real part <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and imaginary part <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples of numbers and where they fit in our typology/cladogram of numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is a real number. It’s also a complex number. It’s not an imaginary number.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is a complex number. It’s also an imaginary number. It’s not a real number.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2+7i\)</span> is a complex number. It’s neither real nor imaginary.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(12i\)</span> is a complex number. It’s also an imaginary number. It’s definitely not a real number.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s a Venn diagram—well, more like an ordinary set-containment diagram—of how the complex numbers relate to the real and imaginary numbers (and whatever even larger classes of numbers there might be):</p>
<p><img src="./complex-numbers-set-diagram.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Often if we just want to talk about the real part or the imaginary part of a number, we’ll describe it with function notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Re(z) = \text{the real part of } z\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Im(z) = \text{the imaginary part of } z\]</span></p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Re(2+7i) = 2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Im(2+7i) = 7\]</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(Im(2+7i)\)</span> is <em>not</em> <span class="math inline">\(7i\)</span>! It’s just <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. The imaginary part is only the <em>coefficient</em> on the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> part.</p>
<p>Somewhat more generally, we can write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Re(a+bi) = a\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Im(a+bi) = b\]</span></p>
<p>Question: can we come up with a formula that takes in a complex number and churns out the real and/or imaginary parts? Like, something more algebraic? Something somewhat more mathematically sophisticated than just pointing to the real or imaginary component and saying “it’s that thing!”</p>
<h2 id="adding">Adding</h2>
<p>We can add two complex numbers together to get a <em>third</em> complex numbers! All we do is add the real part, and add the imaginary part! The two parts stay totally seperate from each other! So, for example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
(5+2i)\,+\,(3+7i) &amp;= (5+3) \,+\,(2+7)i \\
&amp;= 8 + 9i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="subtracting">Subtracting</h2>
<p>We can subtract complex numbers, too.</p>
<h2 id="multiplying">Multiplying</h2>
<p>We can multiply complex numbers! But it’s <em>not</em> quite as simple as addition and subtraction. We <em>don’t</em> independently multiply the real and complex parts:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(5+2i)\cdot(3+7i) \,\neq\, (5\cdot3) + (2\cdot7)i\]</span></p>
<p>Adding complex numbers is easy, because a complex number is just two real numbers added, and so things play together nicely. But when we try to multiply a complex number, then all of a sudden we’re combining <em>multiplication</em> with <em>addition</em>! So we need to think about how those two operations interact. They interact via our old friend, the distributive property:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a(b+c) = ab + ac\]</span></p>
<p>So to multiply two complex numbers, we do the same thing as we would to multiply any other binomial. We can use the distributive law or FOIL it or what-have-you. So, for example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}(3+2i)(5+7i) &amp;= 3\cdot 5 \,+\, 3\cdot7i\,+\,3\cdot2i + 2i\cdot7i \quad \text{(by FOIL or whathaveyou)} \\
&amp;= 15 + 30i + 14i^2 \quad \text{(combining terms)} \\
\text{But wait! $i^2=-1$, so this becomes:}\\
&amp;= 15 + 30i + 14\cdot(-1) \\
&amp;= 1 + 30i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we wanted to make a formula into which we could plug any two complex numbers, we could just take two arbitrary complex numbers, multiply them together, and see what happens. By “arbitrary” I mean that we could take two complex numbers <em>that in fact stand in for all complex numbers</em>. In other words, we could have <span class="math inline">\(a+bi\)</span> as one complex number, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> could be any real number, and we could have <span class="math inline">\(c+di\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> could be any real number. What happens when we multiply them togther?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}(a+bi)(c+di) &amp;= a\cdot c \,+\, a\cdot di\,+\,c\cdot bi + bdi^2 \\
&amp;= ac + (ad + cb)i + bdi^2  \\
&amp;= ac + (ad + cb)i + bd\cdot(-1) \\
&amp;= \underbrace{(ac-bd)}_{\text{real part}} \,+\,  \underbrace{(ad + cb)}_{\text{imaginary part}}\cdot i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>I guess you could memorize this formula if you want to, but there’s no point—since you’re already comfortable and familiar with multiplying out binomials, you should probably just do the same thing you do there (FOIL it or distribute it or whatever). Of course, if you were going to write a computer program that dealt with complex numbers, you’d probably want to write in a formula like this.</p>
<h2 id="dividing">Dividing</h2>
<p>Division is trickiest. Suppose we want to divide two complex numbers, <span class="math inline">\(2+3i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5+7i\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{2+3i}{5+7i}\]</span></p>
<p>Our first question here ought be: is it going to be another complex number, or some more weird and esoteric type of number?? More generally, when we divide two complex numbers, do we always a complex number? If we divide integers, we don’t always get another integer—e.g., <span class="math inline">\(5/7\)</span> is a rational number, not an integer. Of all our four basic arithmetic operations, division is the scariest, and the hardest. We do long division, but we don’t do “long addition.” Division is sometimes wormholes us out to extra dimensions of numbers. We take two nice, clean, well-behaved integers like <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>, divide them, and we get a horrible non-integer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{two nice integers} \rightarrow\quad \frac{5}{7} \,=\, \underbrace{0.714285714285714285714285714285714285714285714285714285714\dots\dots}_{\text{terrifying thing that&#39;s definitely not an integer}}\]</span></p>
<p>So, if we divide two complex numbers, what happens?</p>
<p>We’ll answer that broader question in a minute. But first, back to dividing these two specific complex numbers. <em>If</em> their quotient does indeed turn out to be another complex number, <em>then</em> we should be able to write it in <span class="math inline">\(a+bi\)</span> form. We should be able to figure out what both the real and imaginary parts are. In other words, we should end up with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{2+3i}{5+7i} = (\underbrace{\text{something}}_{\text{the real part}}) + (\underbrace{\text{something else}}_{\text{the imaginary part}})\cdot i\]</span></p>
<p>But how do we actually figure out what those parts are? Fractions are hard. Division is messy (even with real numbers and variables.)</p>
<p>Somehow, we need to bribe, bully, convince, or cajole our quotient to get into that form. The problem is that we’ve got two separate things on the bottom, <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(7i\)</span>. So we can’t just cleanly split the fraction up along those two things. Many of you were trying to do just that last semester, and it made me quite sad:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b+c} \neq \frac{a}{b} + \frac{a}{c}\]</span></p>
<p>However, <em>if</em> we could somehow turn the two things on the bottom into <em>one</em> thing, we’d be set, because then we <em>can</em> split the tops up:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{(\text{something})+(\text{something else})\cdot i}{\text{one thing}} \,=\, \frac{\text{something}}{\text{one thing}} + \frac{\text{something else}}{\text{one thing}}\cdot i\]</span></p>
<p>So if we could do that, then we’d have a complex number, in standard <span class="math inline">\((\text{real part})+(\text{imaginary part})\cdot i\)</span> form. So, how can we do that? Can we get the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> out of the denominator, so that we only have a real number on the bottom?</p>
<p>Here’s the idea: let’s multiply the denominator by itself, but not <em>quite</em> by itself. Let’s change the sign between the real part and the imaginary part, from <span class="math inline">\(+5i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-5i\)</span>. If we do that, what happens?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
(5+7i)\cdot(5-7i) &amp;= 5\cdot5 \,+\, 5\cdot7i \,-\, 5\cdot7i \,-\, (7i)^2 \\
&amp;= 25 \,\,\, \cancel{+\, 5\cdot7i} \,\,\, \cancel{-\,5\cdot7i} \,-\, 7^2i^2 \\
&amp;= 25- 49\cdot(-1) \\
&amp;= 74
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> goes away!!!! The two <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> terms cancel each other out! We get an <span class="math inline">\(i^2\)</span> term, sure, but <span class="math inline">\(i^2\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, so that turns into an ordinary real number, too. No <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>s!!!</p>
<p>So if we multiply the bottom of this fraction by this thing, we’d get rid of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{2+3i}{5+7i}\cdot \frac{}{5-7i} = \frac{}{74}\]</span></p>
<p>There’s a major catch: we can’t go willy-nilly multiplying random parts of our expression by random other numbers. That’s not licit. We can’t do that. It’d turn into something totally different. So if we want to multiply the bottom of the expression by <span class="math inline">\(5-7i\)</span>, then we need to multiply the top by <span class="math inline">\(5-7i\)</span>, too, so that we’re not actually changing anything. Instead, we’re just multiplying it by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>—a weird form of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> nonetheless.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{(2+3i)}{(5+7i)}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{(5-7i)}{(5-7i)}}_{=1}\]</span></p>
<p>So, there’s a cool trick! What if we try multiplying this thing by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>—but by a very special form of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{(2+3i)}{(5+7i)}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{(5-7i)}{(5-7i)}}_{=1}\]</span></p>
<p>Anything over itself is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and we can multiply anything by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> without changing it. We’re not violating any laws of algebra. We’ve found this special form of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> by taking the denominator, and flipping the sign on the imaginary part (i.e., going from <span class="math inline">\(5+7i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(5-7i\)</span>), and then putting that over itself.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s do the full division, and see what happens:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{(2+3i)}{(5+7i)}\cdot\frac{(5-7i)}{(5-7i)} &amp;= \frac{2\cdot5 \,-\, 2\cdot7i \,+\, 5\cdot3i \,-\, 3i\cdot7i}{5\cdot5 \,\underbrace{-\, 5\cdot7i \,+\, 5\cdot7i}_{=0} \,-\, 7i\cdot7i} &amp; \text{(just FOIL&#39;ing)} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{10+i-21i^2}{5\cdot5 \,\underbrace{-\, 5\cdot7i \,+\, 5\cdot7i}_{=0} \,-\, 7i\cdot7i} &amp; \text{(combining terms on the top)} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{10+i-21i^2}{5\cdot5 \,-\, 7i\cdot7i} &amp; \text{(the $i$ terms cancel out on the bottom!)} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{10+i-21i^2}{25 \,-\, 49i^2} &amp; \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{10+i+21}{25 + 49} &amp; (i^2=-1)\\ \\
&amp;= \frac{31+i}{74} &amp; \text{(combining terms)}\\ \\
&amp;= \frac{31}{74} + \frac{i}{74} &amp;\text{(separating into real and imaginary components)}\\ \\
&amp;= \frac{31}{74} + \frac{1}{74}i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we multiply by that very special form of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> terms cancel out on the bottom, and we get just a single real term on the bottom! Then we can split up the fraction, and we can write the quotient as a genuine complex number, with the real and imaginary parts clear and obvious and isolated:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{(2+3i)}{(5+7i)}= \frac{31}{74} + \frac{1}{74}i\]</span></p>
<p>What was that special form of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> that we multiplied by? It’s called the <strong>conjugate</strong> (or the <strong>complex conjugate</strong>). For any given complex number <span class="math inline">\(a+bi\)</span>, its conjugate is <span class="math inline">\(a-bi\)</span>. We often denote it by writing <span class="math inline">\(\text{Conj}(z)\)</span>, or putting a little <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\text{flat hat}}\)</span> on top of the number, or superscripting an asterisk, like <span class="math inline">\(z^*\)</span>. It’s pronounced “[zee] conjugate” or “[zee] star.” More formally,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{ if } z=a+bi,\quad \text{ then $\quad$ Conj}(z)=\overline{z} = z^*= a-bi\]</span></p>
<p>We’ve seen conjugates before; we just haven’t used that name for them. Suppose we’re multiplying together two binomials which are identical except for their signs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(a+b)(a-b)\]</span></p>
<p>The cool thing that happens is that the cross terms (i.e. the <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span> terms) cancel out and disappear!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
(a+b)(a-b) &amp;= a^2 + ab - ab -b^2 \\
&amp;= a^2 - b^2
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>And we’re left with just powers of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. So if we do this with a complex number written as a binomial (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(a+bi\)</span>), the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> terms disappear, and we’re left with just real terms and <span class="math inline">\(i^2\)</span> terms, and since <span class="math inline">\(i^2=-1\)</span>, we’re left in fact with ONLY real terms:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
(a+bi)(a-bi) &amp;= a^2 +abi - abi -b^2i^2 \\
&amp;= a^2 -b^2(-1) \\
&amp;= a^2+b^2
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Hey! You know, this also shows us something ELSE that’s kind of cool. We multiply these two complex numbers together, <em>and we get a real number</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underbrace{(a+bi)(a-bi)}_{\text{complex numbers}} = \underbrace{a^2+b^2}_{\text{a real number}}\]</span></p>
<p>That’s exactly the point—we made up this “conjugate” thing specifically as a way of getting rid of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. But still, it’s a little weird, because it’s like we’re putting together these two complicated objects, and the object we get as a result isn’t an equally-complicated object (or a <em>more</em> complicated object); it’s a <em>simpler</em> object.</p>
<p>That’s… a little weird? I mean, I guess it’s something we’ve seen before. We can multiply two rational numbers and get an integer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{6}{5}\cdot\frac{10}{6} = 2\]</span></p>
<p>But still, it’s like, we’re putting together these two complicated objects, and the object we get as a result isn’t an equally-complicated object (or a <em>more</em> complicated object); it’s a <em>simpler</em> object.</p>
<p>The contrasting example, I guess, is with division: we can divide two integers, and potentially get a number that’s not an integer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{3}{5} = \text{not an integer}\]</span></p>
<p>So in that case, we take two simple objects, combine them, and get a more-complicated object.</p>
<p>Anyway, so we’ve found that if we divide <span class="math inline">\(2+3i\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(5+7i\)</span>, we get another complex number, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{31}{74} + \frac{1}{74}i\)</span>. But that still leaves us with the broader question: if we divide two complex numbers, do we <em>always</em> get another complex number? Or do we sometimes get a scarier and more exotic form of number? When we divide two integers, <em>sometimes</em> we get a scary non-integer, but not <em>always</em>. Sometimes we divide two nice integers, and we get another nice integer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{two integers} \rightarrow\quad \frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \longleftarrow\text{another integer}\]</span></p>
<p>Division, then, is like a dog with aggression problems. Sometimes it acts cute—but other times it tears your face off. You’re never totally sure which you’re going to get. So even when it’s being cute, you can never <em>fully</em> trust it. Likewise here. Can we ever fully trust division of complex numbers? (You’ll work out the answer in one of the homework problems.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the main point to take away from this very long and rambling section is this: <strong>if we want to divide two complex numbers, we can multiply by the conjugate of the denominator (over itself)</strong> to then be able to figure out the resulting complex number (cleanly).</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; width: auto; text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Dividing complex numbers, in summary:</strong></p>

<p>(This still seems kind of messy! If only there were an easier way…)</p>
<h2 id="graphing-complex-numbers">Graphing Complex Numbers</h2>
<p>One way we can think about the real numbers visually is to graph them on a number line! It’s not all that interesting—real numbers are one-dimensional, so they’re just points on a line. (<em>Functions</em> of real numbers is where things start to get interesting, because then we’ve got two dimensions—one for the input, one for the output—and we can start having pretty shapes.)</p>
<p>Complex numbers, on the other hand, <em>are two dimensional</em>. In our construction of them, each complex number is the <em>unified fusion of two real numbers</em>. So if we want to think about complex numbers visually, we need <em>two</em> dimensions—one for each number. Usually we do this by plotting the real component along the horizontal axis (or the <strong>real axis</strong>), and the imaginary component along the vertical axis (or <strong>imaginary axis</strong>).</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of complex numbers plotted on the complex plane:</p>
<p><img src="complex-plane.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<h2 id="some-basic-algebra-with-complex-numbers">Some Basic Algebra With Complex Numbers</h2>
<p>Suppose we have an equation involving a complex number:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4i = z^2 + z\]</span></p>
<p>We’d like to be able to find what values of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> make this equation true. Maybe there’s one value, maybe there are multiple values, maybe there are no values. We’re pretty good at solving equations with real numbers! But what about with complex numbers? I guess we could factor the right-hand side:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4i = z(z+1)\]</span></p>
<p>But that’s not very helpful, since the left side is <span class="math inline">\(4i\)</span>, not <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, so it’s not as easy as just solving the factors individually.</p>
<p>Here’s a better idea. There’s a useful trick for solving equations with complex numbers: every complex number is <em>made up of two real numbers</em>, so <strong>if we have one equation relating one complex number, we can turn it into two equations relating two real numbers</strong>. Let’s continue this example so that I can show you what I mean.</p>
<p>We have this complex number <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, and we know that any complex number can be written in the form <span class="math inline">\(a+bi\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are both real numbers. So then we can turn this equation about a complex number into an equation about some real numbers, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4i = (a+bi)^2 + (a+bi)\]</span></p>
<p>If we simplify that a bit, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
4i &amp;= a^2 + 2bi + b^2i^2 +a+bi \\
4i&amp;= a^2 + 2bi - b^2 + a + bi &amp;\text{(because $i^2=-1$)}\\
4i&amp;= a^2 - b^2 + a + 3bi
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Then we’ve got two complex numbers—one on the left side of the equation, and one on the right side:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
0+4i &amp;= \left(a^2 - b^2 + a\right) + 3bi\\ \\
\underbrace{0}_{\text{real part}} + \underbrace{4}_{\text{imaginary part}}\cdot i \quad&amp;=\quad (\underbrace{a^2 - b^2 + a}_{\text{real part}}) +\underbrace{3b}_{\text{imaginary part}}\cdot i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>This looks like one equation with two unknowns—but actually it’s <em>two</em> equations! Since these two complex numbers on the left and on the right are equal, <strong>their real and imaginary parts must also be equal</strong>. So then, we can set the imaginary parts equal to each other:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4 = 3b\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b = 4/3\]</span></p>
<p>And we’ve found <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>! We’re halfway there to finding the complex number we’re looking for, <span class="math inline">\(z=a+bi\)</span>. Now we just need to find <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. So we can set the real parts equal:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = a^2 - b^2 + a\]</span></p>
<p>Since we’ve found out that <span class="math inline">\(b=4/3\)</span>, we can plug that in:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = a^2 - \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 - a\]</span></p>
<p>Looks like we have a quadratic!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = a^2 + a - \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2\]</span></p>
<p>We can try to factor it, but it turns out to be a mess. Let’s use the quadratic equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
a &amp;= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2- 4\cdot1\cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 }}{2} \\
&amp;\vdots \\
&amp;\text{a whole bunch of arithmetic later...} \\
&amp;\vdots \\
&amp;= \frac{-1}{2} \pm\frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} \\
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>So we’ve found what <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> can be! There are two possibilities! So we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a= \left\{\frac{-1}{2} +\frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} , \quad \frac{-1}{2} -\frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} \right\}\quad\text{and}\quad b=4/3\]</span></p>
<p>So then there are two possible solutions for <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
z =&amp; a+bi \\
= &amp;\left(\frac{-1}{2} +\frac{\sqrt{13}}{4}\right)  \quad+\quad\frac43i ,\\
&amp;\left(\frac{-1}{2} -\frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} \right) \quad+\quad\frac43i 
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Boy, that’s a lot of work! Maybe I should have made a simpler example. Oh well! If you want to verify that those are both solutions, you can plug them back into the original equation.</p>
<h2 id="wait-one-more-fun-thing">Wait, One More Fun Thing</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the square root of negative one—but what if we take <em>the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span></em>?!? Can we even do that?? We saw that cool things happen when we take powers of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>; do cool things happen when we take roots of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>?</p>
<p>Like with dividing numbers, our first question should be: if we take the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, do we even still get a complex number? Or will we get a type of number that’s maybe more complex than a complex number? Or a type of number that’s more simple? Or what???</p>
<p>I guess one way we could start to think about this is to realize that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is itself a square root, and so maybe we should write that out:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt{i} = \sqrt{\sqrt{-1}} = \left((-1)^{1/2}\right)^{1/2} = (-1)^{1/4} = \sqrt[4]{-1}\]</span></p>
<p>Hmm. That doesn’t seem to tell us a whole lot. Let’s try something else.</p>
<p>Let’s assume, for a moment, that if we take the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we get another complex number as a result. If this complex number has real part <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and imaginary part <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then we should have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt{i} = a + bi\]</span></p>
<p>Or, in other words:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[i = (a+bi)^2\]</span></p>
<p>This is something we might be able to do something with! Let’s expand the right side and see what happens. Maybe we’ll be able to solve for <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and thus find the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
i &amp;= (a+bi)^2 \\
 &amp;= a^2 + 2abi + bi^2 \\
 &amp;= a^2 - b^2 + 2abi &amp;\text{because } i^2=-1
 \end{align*}
 \]</span></p>
<p>But now, we’ve proven that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (on the left) must be equal to this more complicated thing (on the right). We have a complex number on the left, and a complex number on the right. They’re equal. They’re the same number. So then their real and imaginary components must also be equal. Showing that a bit more explicitly:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
0 \quad &amp;+ \quad1\cdot i \\
&amp;\,\,|| \\
(a^2 - b^2) \,&amp;+\,\,(2ab)\cdot i
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>The real parts and imaginary parts must be equal—so we get two equations! And we have two unknowns, so we can solve them!</p>
<p>Our first equation, from the real component, is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 = a^2-b^2\]</span></p>
<p>So then <span class="math inline">\(a^2=b^2\)</span>, or just that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = \pm b\]</span></p>
<p>We need the plus-or-minus, because of course the squaring will destroy it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other equation (the imaginary component) gives us:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2ab = 1\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s plug the stuff from the first equation into this one. If we plug in <span class="math inline">\(a=-b\)</span>, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
2(-b)b &amp;= 1 \\
-2b^2 = 1 \\
b = \pm \sqrt{-1/2}
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>BUT we know that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (as well as <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has to be a real number! That’s part of the setup here. Ultimately we’re talking about complex numbers, but we’ve split our complex number into its components <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Both of those numbers are real. There’s no real number equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{-1/2}\)</span>. So this begets no solution. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> can’t be equal to <span class="math inline">\(-b\)</span>. It can thus only be equal to the other alternative, <span class="math inline">\(+b\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about if we plug in <span class="math inline">\(a=+b\)</span>? Then we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
2(b)b &amp;= 1 \\
2b^2 &amp;= 1 \\
b &amp;= \pm 1/\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>So we’ve found <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>! And we know, from the first equation, that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are equal, possibly modulo their sign, except we also found out that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> can’t be negative <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. So we have two possibilities:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a = b = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\]</span></p>
<p>And then we’ve done it! We’ve found the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>!!! We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt{i} = \left\{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \,,\quad \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right\}\]</span></p>
<p>That’s so weird! Where does this come from? Is there a better explanation for why <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{i}\)</span> is this weird number with fractions and <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>? What if we want to find not just the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, but the cube root? or the quartic root? or the quintic root? or the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>’th root? Do we have to do all this nasty, nasty algebra (which, no doubt, will just get worse)? By the way, can we graph these two solutions? What happens? Where are they on the complex plane? Incidentally, doesn’t <span class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{2}\)</span> seem familiar?? Have we seen that anywhere else recently??</p>
<p>If you don’t believe that that really is the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>—if you think our procedure, what with its assumptions, equating real and imaginary components, etc., was a bunch of malarkey—try squaring one (or both) of these. What happens?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i\right)^2 = \hspace{3in} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}i\right)^2 = \hspace{3in}\]</span></p>
<p>Incidentally, we’ve answered our question about whether the square root of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is itself a complex number—it is! We can write it in the form <span class="math inline">\(a+bi\)</span>, so it is indeed complex.</p>
<p>COMPLEX NUMBERS ARE SO WEIRD, eh???</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p><em>Many/most of these problems, especially the hard ones are stolen from the Art of Problem Solving’s </em>Intermediate Algebra} text (which in turn stole many of its problems from various math contests!*</p>
For each of the following pairs of complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>:
Let’s do some algebra with complex numbers! Solve each of the following equations for <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. (Since we know that we can represent any complex number as its real part plus its imaginary part times <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, it might be a good idea to rewrite <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> like that! Or it might not.)
More algebra! Solve for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are both real numbers! (It might help to remember that two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real and imaginary components are equal—so from an equation relating two complex numbers, we can actually get <em>two} equations relating </em>two each} real numbers.)
