</div>
<p>Imagine the following scenario: a tortoise and a hare decide to go on an Aesopian footrace, the prize of which will be eternal glory. Except rather than race down a straight path, or even race down the <em>same</em> path, a Darwinian glitch in the hare’s navigational systems has caused it to hop off at an orthogonal angle<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to the tortoise:</p>
<p><img src="tortoiseandhare1.png" /></p>
<p>This is bad for any number of reasons, among them the fact the winner of the race will not be known until each animal has circumambulated the surface of the earth—the primitive technology available to the tortoises and hares doesn’t allow them to directly measure velocity or distance. Hence the need for direct <em>comparison</em>. Which, I guess, is what one always does in a race—everyone starts and finishes at the same points.</p>
<p>Uh, anyway, as a third complication, a practical jokester (perhaps an otter?) has attached a spool of string to the back of the tortoise, and tied the end of the strong to one of the hare’s ears. So as soon as they start their race, the string starts unspooling, unbeknownst to either of them.</p>
<p>A couple of questions: first of all, when will they run out of string? that is to say, when will the tortoise and the hare feel a sudden jerk back towards each other, and realize that they’re tied together? And, secondly: the amount of internal injuries they suffer will be directly proportional to the force exerted by the string at the moment that it stops them from running independently, which in turn will be proportional to the rate at which the distance between them is changing—i.e., the speed at which the string is coming of the spool. So at the instant they run out of string, how fast is the distance between the tortoise and the hare changing?</p>
<p>(If they were both running in the same direction, we’d just subtract their speeds; if they were both running in opposite directions, we’d add their speeds. You did this in physics last year—you discussed relative motion.) (Note how I’ve used the word “speed” rather than “velocity,” since velocity includes information about direction.))</p>
<p>Let’s assume that the tortoise can run (“run”) <span class="math inline">\(5m/h\)</span> (where “m” means “meter” and not “mile”) and the hare can run <span class="math inline">\(200m/h\)</span>, and that at the beginning of the race, there’s <span class="math inline">\(1000m\)</span> of string on the tortoise’s back. (Assume, for simplicity’s sake, that the weight of the string doesn’t slow the tortoise down.) And let’s let:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(T(t)\)</span> be the position of the tortoise as a function of time
<ul>
<li>then <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;(t)\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(dT/dt\)</span>) is the velocity of the tortoise (as a fxn of time) (which, incidentally, we know is <span class="math inline">\(5m/h\)</span>.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>*<span class="math inline">\(H(t)\)</span> be the position of the hare as a function of time
<ul>
<li>then <span class="math inline">\(H&#39;(t)\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(dH/dt\)</span>) is the velocity of the hare (as a fxn of time) (which, incidentally, we know is <span class="math inline">\(200m/h\)</span>.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, let’s assume there’s <span class="math inline">\(1km\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(1000m\)</span>) of string on the tortoise’s back. Let’s call <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> be the amount of string that has been unspooled (as a function of time)—which, note, is just the distance between the tortoise and the hare. And then <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;(t)\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(dS/dt\)</span>) will be the rate at which the string is unspooling (i.e., the rate at which the distance between the tortoise and the hare is increasing).</p>
<p>So our situation looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="tortoiseandhare2.png" /></p>
<p>(So <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is really just the hypotenuse of this right triangle—which means that the Pythagorean theorem might come into play…)</p>
<p>We want to find a couple things: first, <strong>when do they run out of string?</strong> Meaning, when is the distance between the tortoise and the hare <span class="math inline">\(1000m\)</span>? Meaning, when is <span class="math inline">\(S(t) = 1000\)</span>? (And here “when” means “for what value of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(S(t)=1000\)</span>?”)</p>
<p>Because of the Pythagorean theorem, we must have: <span class="math display">\[(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2 = (S(t))^2 \]</span> For ease of writing, you might wish to drop the “<span class="math inline">\((t)\)</span>”’s: <span class="math display">\[T^2 + H^2 = S^2 \]</span> We want to find when <span class="math inline">\(S=1000\)</span>, so we can plug that in: <span class="math display">\[T^2 + H^2 = 1000^2 \]</span> But how do we solve for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>? We’ll need more information. Luckily, we have more information. We know the velocities of both the tortoise and the hare, and we know that both of these velocities are constant (neither the tortoise nor the hare speed up or slow down). so then after <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> hours, the tortoise has travelled <span class="math inline">\(T(t) = 5\cdot t\)</span> meters, and after <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> hours, the hare has travelled <span class="math inline">\(H(t) = 200\cdot t\)</span> meters<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> So we know: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
T(t) &amp;= 5t \\
H(t) &amp;= 200t
\end{align*}\]</span> If we plug these into our Pythagorean thing, we get: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(5t)^2 + (200t))^2 &amp;= 1000^2 \\
25t^2 + 200^2t^2 &amp;= 1000^2
\intertext{I haven&#39;t bothered squaring $1000$ and $25$, because that&#39;s too much writing---and I can always let the calculator take care of it. Now, if I solve for $t$:}
t^2(25+200^2) &amp;= 1000^2\\
t^2 &amp;= 1000^2/(25+200^2)\\
t &amp;= \sqrt{1000^2/(25+200^2)}\\
t &amp;\approx  4.99
\end{align*}\]</span> So the hare and the tortoise will be running for about five hours before they run out of string. It’ll take about four hours before they notice that they’re tied to each other.</p>
<p>Second question: <strong>what is the rate at which the distance between the animals is changing at the instant they run out of string?</strong> (I.e., when <span class="math inline">\(S(t) = 1000\)</span>.) Put differently, what is <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;(t)\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(dS/dt\)</span>) when <span class="math inline">\(S=1000\)</span>? <strong>This is the crucial idea here</strong>: we can think of the derivative as a <em>rate of change</em>. <span class="math inline">\(dy/dx\)</span> is the amount that <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> changes for every change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. By “rate” we usually mean “change per unit time,” and so something like <span class="math inline">\(dS/dt\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;(t)\)</span> is the rate at which <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> changes, per some change in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Velocity is a rate—e.g., miles <strong>per</strong> hour. And it’s just a derivative—the derivative of position. So I guess we’ll want to find <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;(t)\)</span> to find the speed at which the distance is changing (at any time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), and then plug in <span class="math inline">\(4.99\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to find the speed at that moment.</p>
<p>We already know: <span class="math display">\[(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2 = (S(t))^2 \]</span> So I guess if we want to find <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;(t)\)</span>, we’ll need to take a derivative! We could do it in two ways: either solve for <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> and then differentiate, or differentiate and then solve for <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we differentiate and then solve, we get: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2 &amp;= (S(t))^2\\
\frac{d}{dt}\left[ (T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2\right] &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\left[ (S(t))^2\right] \\
2T(t)\cdot T&#39;(t) + 2H(t)\cdot H&#39;(t) &amp;= 2S(t)\cdot S&#39;(t) \\
S&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{2T(t) T&#39;(t) + 2H(t) H&#39;(t)}{2S(t)} \\
S&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{T(t) T&#39;(t) + H(t) H&#39;(t)}{S(t)}
\end{align*}\]</span> Alternatively, if I first solve for <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> and then differentiate: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2 &amp;= (S(t))^2
\intertext{so then}
S(t) &amp;= \sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}\\
\intertext{differentiating...}
\frac{d}{dt}\left[ S(t) \right] &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\left[\sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}\right] \\\\
S&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}}\cdot \left(2T(t) T&#39;(t) + 2H(t) H&#39;(t) \right) \\\\
&amp;= \frac{2T(t) T&#39;(t) + 2H(t) H&#39;(t)}{2\sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}} \\\\
&amp;= \frac{T(t) T&#39;(t) + H(t) H&#39;(t)}{\sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}} \\\\
\intertext{but since we know that $S(t) = \sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}$, we can simplify this to:}
S&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{T(t) T&#39;(t) + H(t) H&#39;(t)}{S(t)}
\end{align*}\]</span> So, either way I get the same thing! We get that: <span class="math display">\[S&#39;(t) = \frac{T(t) T&#39;(t) + H(t) H&#39;(t)}{S(t)}\]</span> (I’m sorry if these two derivations were hard to read; I think all the “<span class="math inline">\((t)\)</span>”s made it needlessly messy, but I wanted to put them in there just so you wouldn’t forget that <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are all functions of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>… I dunno. If you find them confusing, try writing them out without the ``<span class="math inline">\((t)\)</span>’’s, and see if it’s clearer.)</p>
<p>So this tells us the rate (the speed) at which the distance between the tortoise and the hare is changing as a function of time. Or rather, as a function of the distance the tortoise and the hare have each travelled, as well as their speeds and the distance between them. We can simplify it a bit. First of all, we know the speeds of the tortoise and the hare (we know <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;(t) = 5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H&#39;(t) = 200\)</span>), so we can plug those in: <span class="math display">\[S&#39;(t) = \frac{T(t)\cdot 5+ H(t)\cdot 200}{S(t)}\]</span> Likewise, we also know that <span class="math inline">\(S(t) = \sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}\)</span>, so if we plug that in: <span class="math display">\[S&#39;(t) = \frac{T(t)\cdot 5+ H(t)\cdot 200}{\sqrt{(T(t))^2 + (H(t))^2}}\]</span> And since we know that <span class="math inline">\(H(t) = 200t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T(t) = 5t\)</span>, we have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
S&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{5t\cdot 5+ 200t\cdot 200}{\sqrt{((5t)^2 + (200t)^2}}
\intertext{or:}
 &amp;= \frac{25t+ 200^2t}{\sqrt{25t^2 + 200^2t^2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{t(25+ 200^2)}{\sqrt{(t^2)(25 + 200^2)}} \\
&amp;= \frac{t(25+ 200^2)}{\sqrt{t^2}\sqrt{25 + 200^2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{t(25+ 200^2)}{t\sqrt{25 + 200^2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{25+ 200^2}{\sqrt{25 + 200^2}} \\
&amp;\approx 200.0625 \,m/s
\end{align*}\]</span> So that means that the distance between the tortoise and the hare is increasing at a constant rate—at a speed of a little more than <span class="math inline">\(200\)</span> meters per second! So at the instant that the string runs out, the tortoise and the hare are getting further apart at a rate of about 200 meters per second. (Which is close to the hare’s speed—that’s because the difference in speeds is so great. If they were going at similar speeds, we’d get something different… this is close to the scenario in which the hare is speeding along and the tortoise is standing still.)</p>

<p>Here’s another good example. You’re in Arizona. You’re trying to get to Tombstone, but your party was massacred by Indians/bandits/wild animals somewhere north of Nogales. You’re the only survivor. So you’ve been walking for days, with no sign of anything living. And then you see it: train tracks. They extend to the horizon like a pencil line in two-point perspective, and just before the vanishing point rises an object that you remember from your boyhood days studying Euclid: a cone. Are you hallucinating? Are you so close to death that time is melting? Are you in the desert or in Mr. Dick’s class? Are you entering the Platonic world of shapes?</p>
<p>The cone, though, isn’t quite a cone: it’s an inverted cone, raised up above the ground and supported on an iron lattice. It’s a water tower. You straggle forth. The water tower must be miles away but in what seems like minutes you’re underneath it, lapping up the drip-drip-dripping coming from the leak at the very vertex of the cone. The water tastes like rust, but it also tastes like water, which is delicious and revivifying. So you lie down directly underneath the leak and open your mouth. You don’t have a cup or anything to catch the water with. All you have is your mouth. But that’s OK, because you could lie there and drink water all day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that won’t be possible. There’s only a finite amount of water in the tank. Moreover: the rate at which the water is dripping out of the tank is {} over time. The rate at which the water drips will be proportional to the amount of water in the tank—the more water there is in the tank, the greater the water pressure at the vetex will be, and the faster it’ll drip—and so the more water that drips out, the less water there is, and the less the pressure there is, and the slower it drips.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you don’t actually care about the amount of water in the tank. Let’s imagine, instead, that the water is sort of like an IV for you—that you need to drink a certain amount of water per unit time, lest you lapse back into unconsciousness. You do not want to return to your dessicated desert delerium. You need to be drinking at least <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> cubic centimeters of water per minute to remain conscious.</p>
<p>Uh. Crud. I just realized that this problem, the way I’m setting it up, is a bit beyond your level. This always happens when I write word problems—I get way too involved and write stuff that’s too complicated and elaborate. Look, let’s just do a dumb problem involving a stupid cone and water dripping.</p>
<p>OK, so imagine you have a cone or a funnel or something and water is dripping out of it. Let’s imagine that cone is 10 feet in diameter at the opening and 15 feet tall, and that the water is dripping at a constant rate of one cubic foot per hour. That’s a stupid assumption to make—the water {} drip at a consant rate—but all of the textbooks love making that assumption. So, anyway, water drips out, the water leve in the cone changes, and the surface area of the water in the cone changes, too. Let’s say that the height of the water at any given time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(h_\text{water}(t)\)</span>. Then I have a situation like this:</p>
<p>I’ve labelled the radius of the water level in the cone as <span class="math inline">\(r_\text{water}(t)\)</span>. So, the typical textbook question to ask now—not like you’d really care, were you dying of thirst in the Sonoran desert—the typical question to ask is ``at what rate is the water level falling?’’</p>
<p>So really we are asking, at what rate is the height of the water changing? Or: what is <span class="math inline">\(dh_\text{water}/dt\)</span> a/k/a <span class="math inline">\(h_\text{water}&#39;(t)\)</span>? I guess we’ll need to find an equation with <span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span> in it that we can differentiate.</p>
<p>What do we know? We know the rate at which water is leaving the cone: if the volume of water is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{water}\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[\frac{dV_\text{water}}{dt} = V_\text{water}&#39;(t) = -1ft^3/h\]</span> We also know that the volume of a cone with radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is:<span class="math display">\[V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h\]</span></p>
<p>Here, of course, we have two cones: we have the actual container, with a permanent height of <span class="math inline">\(15ft\)</span> and radius of <span class="math inline">\(10ft\)</span>. And inside of that, we have a cone of water, whose height and radius are changing (as the water is leaking out).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{water} = \frac{1}{3}\pi r_\text{water}^2h_\text{water}\]</span> Or if I write it to remind myself that these things are all functions of time: <span class="math display">\[V_\text{water}(t) = \frac{1}{3}\pi (r_\text{water}(t))^2h_\text{water}(t)\]</span></p>
<p>Our question is ``at what rate is the water level falling?’’? So really we are asking, at what rate is the height of the water changing? Or: what is <span class="math inline">\(dh_\text{water}/dt\)</span> a/k/a <span class="math inline">\(h_\text{water}&#39;(t)\)</span>? We want to find this. We could do this a couple ways: we could solve this equation for <span class="math inline">\(h_\text{water}\)</span> and take a derivative, or we could differentiate what we have implicitly and then solve for <span class="math inline">\(h_\text{water}&#39;(t)\)</span>.</p>
But let’s simplify it a bit before we do either. We have three functions here—the volume, the height, and the radius. We can simplify this. We can reduce <span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r(t)\)</span> to just one function. We know that the radius of the container cone is <span class="math inline">\(10ft\)</span> and the height of the container cone is <span class="math inline">\(15ft\)</span>, and we know that any cone inside of this one will have the same proportions (because of similar triangles or something):
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}\frac{r_\text{cone}}{h_\text{cone}} &amp;= \frac{r_\text{water}}{h_\text{water}} \\
\frac{10}{15} &amp;= \frac{r_\text{water}}{h_\text{water}}\\
r_\text{water} &amp;= \frac{10}{15}h_\text{water}\\
r_\text{water} &amp;= \frac{2}{3}h_\text{water}\\
\end{align*}\]</span> So really, we know that:<span class="math display">\[r_\text{water}(t) = \frac{2}{3}h_\text{water}(t)\]</span> We can plug this back into our formula for the volume of water and get: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}V_\text{water}(t) &amp;= \frac{1}{3}\pi (r_\text{water}(t))^2h_\text{water}(t)\\
 &amp;= \frac{1}{3}\pi \left(\frac{2}{3}h_\text{water}(t)\right)^2h_\text{water}(t)\\
 &amp;=\frac{1}{3}\pi\cdot\frac{4}{9}(h_\text{water}(t))^2\cdot h _\text{water}(t) \\
&amp;=\frac{4}{27}\pi (h_\text{water}(t))^3 \\
\end{align*}\]</span> This is a bit easier to deal with. So. So I know <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{water}(t)\)</span>. I want to find <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;(t)\)</span>. I should probabaly take a derivative! I could either take what I have and solve it for <span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span> and then differentiate; alternatively, I could just differentiate what I have implicitly, and solve for <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;(t)\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( V_\text{water}(t)\right) &amp;= \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{4}{27}\pi (h_\text{water}(t))^3  \right) \\
V_\text{water}&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{4}{27}\pi\cdot3 (h_\text{water}(t))^2\cdot h_\text{water}&#39;(t) \\
V_\text{water}&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{4}{9}\pi\cdot (h_\text{water}(t))^2\cdot h_\text{water}&#39;(t) \\
\intertext{so then if I solve for $h&#39;(t)$}
h_\text{water}&#39;(t) &amp;= \frac{V_\text{water}&#39;(t)}{\frac{4}{9}\pi\cdot (h_\text{water}(t))^2}
\end{align*}\]</span> We’ve found it! But we can simplify this a bit. We already know another way of writing <span class="math inline">\(V&#39;_\text{water}(t)\)</span>. We know it’s just equal to <span class="math inline">\(-1ft^3/hr\)</span>. So if we plug this in: <span class="math display">\[h&#39;(t) = \frac{-1}{\frac{4}{9}\pi\cdot (h_\text{water}(t))^2}\]</span> simplifying: <span class="math display">\[h&#39;(t) = \frac{-9}{4\pi (h_\text{water}(t))^2}\]</span> There it is! There’s the rate at which the water level is falling! I might be curious about a specific case: for instance, at the instant that the water is <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> feet deep, how fast is the water level falling?

Imagine that the radius of a circle is changing over time. Can you come up with a function for the area of the circle as a function of time? Can you come up with a function for the rate at which the area of the circle changes (possibly in terms of the radius and the rate at which the radius is changing)?
</li>
<li>
Likewise, imagine that the radius of a sphere is changing over time. (Like, you’re inflating a balloon or something.) Can you come up with an expression for the volume of the sphere as a function of time? Can you come up with an expression for the rate at which the volume changes (again, as a function of the radius and the rate the radius changes)?
</li>
<li>
Or imagine this. Imagine you have a balloon-inflating machine that inflates balloons at a rate of three cubic centimeters per second. Assume that the balloon is a sphere. You know two different ways of writing <span class="math inline">\(V&#39;(t)\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(dV/dt\)</span>)—you know it’s <span class="math inline">\(3cm/s\)</span>, and since you also know the equation for the volume of a sphere, you can differentiate it (with respect to time, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) and get the second way of writing <span class="math inline">\(dV/dt\)</span>. Do that. Can you come up with an expression for the rate at which the radius of the balloon changes over time?

Assuming that Ohm’s law holds (which it doesn’t always), the power <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of an electrical circuit is given by <span class="math inline">\(P = Ri^2\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the resistance of the circuit and <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the current.
<ol>
<li>
If the resistance of the circuit changes over time, but current remains constant, how does the power through the circuit change over time?
</li>
<li>
If the current through the circuit changes over time, but the resistance remains constant, how does the power of the circuit change over time?
</li>
<li>
If both the current and the resistance change over time, how does the power through the circuit change?
</li>
<li>
If neither the current nor the resistance change, how does the power through the circuit change?
</li>
</ol>
Note that in none of these questions do you know {} this stuff changes with time. You simply know, for example, that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is <em>somehow</em> a function of time—that if <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> changes, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> changes, too. (The usual abbreviation for this would be “<span class="math inline">\(i=i(t)\)</span>.”) You don’t know, for example, that it changes at three amps per second. You know that it <em>doesn’t</em> change at zero units per second (it’s not constant), but that’s all you know.

When the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and eight oclock and then I was in time again, hearing the watch. It was Grandfather’s and when Father gave it to me he said I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it’s rather excruciating-ly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father’s. I give it to you not that you may remember time but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.
