title: Some Totally Unremarkable Problems With Integrals

Some problems to do, right now, on a separate sheet of paper. Draw pictures for *all* of these problems.

<ol class='problems'>
<li> Using our formula about how integrals involve antiderivatives and subtraction (the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**), calculate:
$$ \int_5^{12} \!x^2\,dx$$
Then calculate:
$$ \int_5^{12} \!-x^2\,dx$$
Compare and contemplate your results. (Note that I am not asking you here to find a certain area---I am asking you to *calculate an integral*.) </li>
<li> Likewise, calculate both:
$$\int_0^\pi \!\sin(x)\,dx \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad \int_\pi^{2\pi} \!\sin(x)\,dx$$
Then calculate:
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \!\sin(x)\,dx$$
</li>
<li> Make a conjecture^[fancy math word for a guess] about the relationship between:
$$ \int_a^b\! f(x)\,dx  \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad  \int_a^b \!-f(x)\,dx$$
\item Then calculate both:
$$\int_{12}^5 \!x^2\,dx  \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad  \int_\pi^0 \!\sin(x)\,dx$$ </li>
<li> How are these different from the above problems? Make a conjecture about the relationship between:
$$ \int_a^b \!f(x)\,dx  \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad   \int_b^a \!f(x)\,dx$$
</li>
