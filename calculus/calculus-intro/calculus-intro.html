<h1 class="title">Calculus: In The Beginning Was The Derivative</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>In 1665, the bubonic plague swept across England.</strong> Twenty-five percent of the population died. King Charles II and his court escaped London for the relative safety of the countryside. Oxford and Cambridge Universities both shut down, sending all the students home. Forced to return to his hometown of Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth and continue his mathematical explorations by himself was one young student named Isaac Newton. It was then and there that he discovered calculus.</p>
<p>Calculus often gets butchered and bowdlerized into a confusing mess of scary symbolism, “a tale / Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury / Signifying nothing.” But calculus, at its core, is about <strong>two very simple ideas</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>How do we find the slopes of curvy lines?</strong> We’ve known for years how to find the slopes of straight lines—but what about curvy lines? <img src="straight-and-curvy-lines.svg" style="width:75.0%" /></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do we find the areas of curvy shapes?</strong> We’ve known for years how to find the areas of boxy, geometric shapes—triangles, squares, and so forth. But what about blobby, curvier shapes? <img src="curvy-and-geometric-area.svg" style="width:75.0%" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, that’s an overcomplification. Calculus, at its core, is about <strong>one simple idea</strong>. The incredible idea at the core of calculus is that these two separate questions <em>are in fact the same question</em>. The same process we can use to find the slopes of curvy lines we can use to find the areas of curvy shapes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This is remarkable.</p>
<h2 id="simsimsimcurvy-slopessimsimsim"><span class="math inline">\(\sim\sim\sim\)</span>Curvy slopes?<span class="math inline">\(\sim\sim\sim\)</span></h2>
<p>It’ll take us a while to build up to understanding this single core idea. Let’s start more simply, by thinking about the slopes of curvy functions. We might initially ask: is the “slope” of a curvy line even a reasonable concept? After all, the way we traditionally think about slopes, it’s:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{slope} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\]</span></p>
<p>But the thing with a curvy line is, the slope is changing at every single point! So each point has a different slope. But just because the slope isn’t the same everywhere doesn’t mean we can’t have a slope! For example, suppose you’re up at Tahoe, about to race down a run like this:</p>
<p><img src="skier-tahoe-slope-1.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Would you say, “this run doesn’t have the same slope everywhere—the slope is changing! It’s not a straight line! Therefore, it doesn’t have a slope!” Of course not! Rather, if you were thinking about the steepness about the run, you’d probably think it goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, the run is flat. So the slope is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, or close to it.</li>
<li>Then, the run starts going down. So the slope becomes negative.</li>
<li>The run starts getting steeper. So the slope becomes <em>more</em> negative.</li>
<li>Then the run starts getting less steep. It’s still going down, just less so. So the slope is still negative, but it’s less negative.</li>
<li>At the bottom, the run becomes flat again. So the slope returns to being <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="skier-tahoe-slope-2.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p><img src="skier-tahoe-slope-3.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>So, the slope is some number that’s changing over time. We could doodle a sketch of the slope itself, as a function itself! It’d look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="skier-tahoe-slope-slope.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>The slope is <em>itself</em> a function! That’s pretty cool. When we think about the slopes of straight lines, I guess those are functions, too—it’s just that they’re very boring functions. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = 3x-2\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{slope}(x) = 3\]</span></p>
<p>The function “3” is just a flat horizontal line, so it’s very boring, but it’s still a function:</p>
<p><img src="slope-of-straight-line.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>We could go on! We could even start thinking about the slope of the slope, or the slope of the slope of the slope, or…</p>
<h3 id="lets-do-another-example">Let’s do another example</h3>
<p>What about one of our favorite functions: <span class="math display">\[f(x) = x^2\]</span> Does it have a slope? What can we figure out about it? Well, we know that <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="x-squared-and-slope-1.svg" style="width:75.0%" /> What’s going on with its slope? Moving from left to right, here’s what’s going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the far left, the function is going down steeply</li>
<li>Then it goes down less steeply</li>
<li>Then it’s flat for a moment</li>
<li>Then it starts going up, shallowly</li>
<li>Then it starts going up steeply</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="x-squared-and-slope-2.svg" style="width:75.0%" /> So then, if we think about what its slope is as a number:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the far left, the function is going down steeply, so its slope is very negative (it’s a big negative number)</li>
<li>Then it goes down less steeply, so the slope is still negative, but less so</li>
<li>Then it’s flat for a moment, at the minimum, so the slope is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> there</li>
<li>Then it starts going up, shallowly, so the slope is positive, but only slightly</li>
<li>Then it starts going up steeply, so the slope is very positive (it’s a big positive number)!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="x-squared-and-slope-3.svg" style="width:75.0%" /> Let’s sketch a doodle of the slope, on the same axes as <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> itself. The slope, thought of as a function itself, is negative to the left of the origin, is zero at the origin, and is positive to the right of the origin, so maybe it looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="x-squared-and-derivative-sketch.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>It looks kind of like <span class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>! I mean, this is just a doodle. It could also be <span class="math inline">\(y=5x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=\frac{1}{10}x\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(y=x^3\)</span>, or really anything that starts in the lower-left quadrant, passes through the origin, and then ends up in the upper-right quadrant. We don’t know! We just have a general idea of what the slope probably is. Presumably it looks sort of like that!</p>
<h3 id="heres-a-waaay-more-complicated-example.">Here’s a waaay more complicated example.</h3>
<p>Here’s some function:</p>
<p><img src="some-function-1.svg" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>What will its slope be? Let’s think about what’s going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the far left, the function is going up. So the slope is positive.</li>
<li>As we move to the right, we hit a maximum, so the slope will be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> there.</li>
<li>Then the function starts going down, so the slope is negative.</li>
<li>Then we hit a minimum, so the slope will be zero.</li>
<li>Then the function starts going back up, so the slope will be positive.</li>
<li>The function gets steeper and steeper, so the slope will be more and more positive</li>
<li>… but then the function starts getting less and less steep, so the slope, while still positive, is getting smaller.</li>
<li>Finally, it looks like the function is asymptotically becoming flat, So the slope will approach <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="some-function-2.svg" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<h2 id="can-we-calculate-exact-equations-of-the-slopes">Can we calculate exact equations of the slopes?</h2>
<p>Pictures are nice. <em>But we can’t finger-paint our way to truth.</em> We want certainty. <em>We want an equation.</em> For example, we saw that if we finger-painted the slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, it looked like it might just be <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, or it might be <span class="math inline">\(5x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0.1x\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, or any <span class="math inline">\(x^\text{odd}\)</span>. Which is it???</p>
<p>Here’s my proposal. We don’t know how to find the exact slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, or the exact slope of any other curvy function. But we do know how to find the exact slope of straight lines. So let’s try to <em>approximate</em> the slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, by approximating it as (a bunch of) straight lines. So, for example, let’s suppose we want to find the approximate slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> between two arbitrary points, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and another point <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> units away, <span class="math inline">\(x+h\)</span>: <img src="x-squared-and-slope-calculation-1.svg" /> The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinates of those points are <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((x+h)^2\)</span>, respectively. We can draw a straight line between those two points: <img src="x-squared-and-slope-calculation-2.svg" /> The straight line between those two points will be a rough estimation of the slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> between those two points. Let’s calculate it. We know that the two points are: <span class="math display">\[\left(x,x^2\right)\quad\text{and}\quad\Big(\,(x+h),\,(x+h)^2\,\Big)\]</span> And we know how to find the slope of a straight line between any two points. We need to find the change in the vertical, and divide it by the change in the horizontal. The vertical change is <span class="math inline">\(\left(x+h\right)^2-x^2\)</span>; the horizontal change is <span class="math inline">\((x+h)-h\)</span>, or just <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>: <img src="x-squared-and-slope-calculation-3.svg" /> So, plugging things in, we have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\substack{\text{approximate slope of }x^2\\\text{ between }x\text{ and }x+h} \quad &amp;= \,\,\text{slope of that straight line} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}  \\ \\
&amp;= \frac{(x+h)^2 - x^2}{(x+h) - x}\\ \\
&amp;\text{expanding:}\\
&amp;= \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{(x+h) - x}\\ \\
&amp;\text{canceling stuff:}\\
&amp;= \frac{\cancel{x^2} + 2xh + h^2 - \cancel{x^2}}{\cancel{x}+h - \cancel{x}}\\
&amp;= \frac{2xh + h^2}{h}\\ \\
&amp;\text{canceling more...}\\
&amp;= \frac{2x\cancel{h} + \cancel{h}^2}{\cancel{h}}\\ \\
&amp;= 2x+h
\end{align*}\]</span> So the slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> between those two points is approximately <span class="math inline">\(2x+h\)</span>! It’s not <em>exactly</em> that—the slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> is changing, after all—but it’s roughly equal to that. <img src="x-squared-and-slope-calculation-4.svg" /> When is this going to be a bad approximation? If the two points are really far apart! In other words, if <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is really big. When is this going to be a good approximation? When the two points are really close together! What’s going to make this a better and better approximation? Moving the two points closer together! <img src="x-squared-and-slope-calculation-close-together.svg" /> What if we wanted a really, really, really, <em>really</em> good approximation of the slope? We’d just need to make <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> really, really, really, <em>really</em> small.</p>
<p>What if we wanted not just an <em>approximation</em> of the slope, but the <em>exact</em> slope??? <em>We could just make <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> equal to zero!!!!</em> And then we’d have: <span class="math display">\[\Big(\text{the approximate slope of }x^2\Big) = 2x+h\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\hspace{1in}\text{as }h \text{ gets}\, \Bigg\downarrow\, \text{really small...} \]</span> <span class="math display">\[\Big(\text{the exact slope of }x^2 \Big) = 2x\]</span> That’s it! <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span>! That matches our intuition! We’ve found it! The exact slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>!!!! It’s not <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(5x\)</span>—it’s just <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span>! (I wonder if there’s a connection between the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>???)</p>
<p>So, for example, if we want to find the slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> at any <em>particular</em> point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we can just plug the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-value into <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span>. For example, at <span class="math inline">\(x=8\)</span>, the function <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> should have a slope of <span class="math inline">\(2\cdot8=16\)</span>. Does that seem reasonable? Yeah, I suppose! It’s pretty steep there. At <span class="math inline">\(x=-2\)</span>, the function <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> should have a slope of <span class="math inline">\(2\cdot(-2) = -4\)</span>. Does that seem reasonable? Yeah, it’s somewhat less steep there (and it’s going down, so the slope should be negative). <img src="x-squared-with-specific-slopes.svg" /> In fact, because <span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span> is a function, we could even graph it alongside <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>: <img src="x-squared-and-actual-derivative.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<h2 id="in-summary">In <span class="math inline">\(\sum\)</span>mary</h2>
<p>To summarize, what we’ve done is to try to find the slope of a curvy line by approximating it as the slope of a straight line: <span class="math display">\[\text{the average slope of } f \text{ between }x\text{ and }x+h \quad=\quad \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span> This approximation gets better and better as <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> gets closer and closer to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. This approximation, then, turns into the <em>actual</em> slope: <span class="math display">\[\substack{\text{the average slope of } f\\\text{(between }x\text{ and }x+h)}  \quad\quad \xrightarrow[\quad\text{reeeally small}\quad]{\text{as h gets}} \quad\quad \substack{\text{the actual slope of } f\\\text{(at $x$)}}  \]</span> Or: <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}  \quad\quad \xrightarrow[\quad\text{reeeally small}\quad]{\text{as h gets}} \quad\quad \text{the actual slope of }f(x)\]</span></p>
<h2 id="notes-on-notation">Notes on Notation</h2>
<p>Okay, let’s deal with some of the fine print. First of all, rather than keep having to write out “the slope of such-and-such,” let’s come up with some notation for it. There are two notations people usually use for slopes; I flip back and forth between them, depending on the context: <span class="math display">\[\text{the slope of }f(x) = f&#39;(x)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{the slope of }f(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\Big(f(x)\Big)= \frac{df}{dx}\]</span> So, for example: <span class="math display">\[\text{if }f(x)=x^2\text{, then }f&#39;(x)=2x\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\left(x^2\right)&#39; = 2x\]</span> Using the other notation: <span class="math display">\[\text{if }f(x)=x^2\text{, then }\frac{df}{dx}=2x\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(x^2\right)= 2x\]</span> There are many more notations people use for slopes, but we’ll stick with these two for now. Also, the name these things usually go by is <strong>derivative</strong>. You can call them “slopes” if you want, because that’s what they are, but “derivative” is the name most people use.</p>
<p>Here’s how these notations get pronounced: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
f&#39;(x)&amp;:\quad \text{“$f$ prime of $x$”} \\
\frac{df}{dx}&amp;: \quad\text{“d f d x”}
\end{align*}\]</span> The expression for the average slope of a function between the points <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x+h\)</span> is often called <strong>Fermat’s Difference Quotient</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\text{Fermat&#39;s Difference Quotient} = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span> Finally, this whole “making <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> really, really small” procedure is known as a <strong>limit</strong>. It’s the same thing as we were doing in November when we were taking the limits of sequences as they go to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, just here we’re making something go to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. This is the notation that often gets used: <span class="math display">\[\text{“the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is L” is }\quad\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x) = L\]</span> Or: <span class="math display">\[\text{“the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is L” is }\quad f(x)  \xrightarrow[\quad c \quad]{x} L\]</span> So, in the context of a derivative, we’d use it like:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f&#39;(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\left( \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \right)\]</span> Or:<br />
<span class="math display">\[\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\quad \xrightarrow[\quad 0 \quad]{h}\quad f&#39;(x)\]</span></p>
<h2 id="why-arent-you-mad-at-me">Why aren’t you mad at me?</h2>
<p>Speaking of limits, this whole “make <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> equal to zero” thing should make you really, really upset, because aren’t we then dividing by zero?!?! <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \,\, \xrightarrow[\quad 0 \quad]{h}\,\, \frac{f(x+0) - f(x)}{0} \,\,=\,\, \frac{f(x)-f(x)}{0} \,\,=\,\, \frac{0}{0}\quad ?!?!?!?!\]</span></p>

(Check your work—does the equation you found for the slope of the function look plausibly correct?)</p>

<p>We’d like to be able to learn more about how slopes work. Tediously calculating the slope of every function we’re interested in one-by-one using Fermat’s Difference Quotient would be… quite the pain. Perhaps we can figure out some shortcuts!</p>

Can we split derivatives up along addition? In other words, is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\text{the derivative of }\Big(\, f(x)+g(x)\,\Big) \quad &amp;\stackrel{???}{=}\quad \big(\, \text{the derivative of }f(x)\,\big) \,\,+\,\, \big( \, \text{the derivative of }g(x)\,\big) \\ \\
\Big(\, f(x)+g(x)\,\Big)&#39; \quad&amp; \stackrel{???}{=}\quad f&#39;(x) \,\,+\,\,g&#39;(x) \\ \\
\frac{d}{dx}\Big(\, f(x)+g(x)\,\Big) \quad &amp;\stackrel{???}{=}\quad \frac{d}{dx}\Big( \, f(x)\,\Big) \,\,+\,\, \frac{d}{dx}\Big( \, g(x)\,\Big)
\end{align*}\]</span> If this is true, prove it (using more-or-less the same method you used to calculate all the other derivatives above). If it’s false, find a counterexample.
</li>
<li>
Can we pull constants out of derivatives? In other words, is: <span class="math display">\[\text{the derivative of }\Big(k\cdot f(x)\Big) \,\,\stackrel{???}{=}\,\, k\cdot\big(\, \text{the derivative of }f(x)\,\big)\]</span> We can do this for iterated and infinite sums, if you recall. Can we do it with derivatives? If we can, prove it (using more-or-less the same method you used to calculate all the other derivatives above). If it’s false, find a counterexample.
</li>
<li>
What about subtraction? Can we split derivatives up along subtraction? If we can’t, find a counterexample. If we can, prove it. You could prove it either by going through this same tedious procedure involving Fermat’s Difference Quotient, or you could perhaps find a more clever way.
<li>
Can we split derivatives up along multiplication? <span class="math display">\[\Big(\, f(x)\cdot g(x)\,\Big)&#39; \quad\stackrel{???}{=}\quad f&#39;(x) \,\,\cdot\,\,g&#39;(x)\]</span> Again, either prove that we can, or prove that we can’t. To prove it, try plugging it into Fermat’s Difference Quotient and simplifying it. To disprove it, try searching for a counterexample (a time when this potential rule would be broken).
</li>
<li>
How ’bout division? <span class="math display">\[\left(\, \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\,\right)&#39; \,\stackrel{???}{=}\, \frac{f&#39;(x)}{g&#39;(x)}\]</span>

Can you calculate the slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>? This gets a bit tricky, because if we plug this into our Fermat’s Difference Quotient procedure, we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{(x+h)^n - x^n}{h}\]</span> And how do we deal with that <span class="math inline">\((x+h)^n\)</span>??? Here’s a hint: think back to (and possibly look up) the binomial theorem (which I think you learned about in Math 2). Can you use the binomial theorem, and your skills at manipulating iterated series (which we talked about in the fall), to calculate it? In other words, don’t just <em>guess</em> what the answer is; actually <em>prove</em> it!!!

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>That’s why we say that Newton discovered calculus. For centuries, or even millennia, people had <em>ad hoc</em> methods for answering these two questions, at least in some simple and easy cases. The Greeks knew how to find the area of a circle, and the slope of a parabola. But it was Newton—and Leibniz, who discovered calculus simultaneously and independently, in Germany—who first realized that these two questions were in fact the same question.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
