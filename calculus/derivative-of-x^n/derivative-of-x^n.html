<h1 class="title">the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(nx^{n-1}\)</span></h1>
</div>
<p>We’ve taken lots of derivatives. We’ve started to notice a pattern. Visually, we’ve seen that the slope of a polynomial appears to be one degree less than the polynomial itself. Algebraically, we’ve done tedious calculations with Fermat’s Difference Quotient, and have figured out: <span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(x^2\right) = 2x \hspace{2cm} \frac{d}{dx}\left(x^3\right) = 3x^2 \hspace{2cm} \frac{d}{dx}\left(x^4\right) = 4x^3 \hspace{2cm}\text{etc.}\]</span> Is this pattern more than just a coincidence? Is it true, in the general case, that for any value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[ \frac{d}{dx}\left(x^n\right) \,\overset{???}{=}\,   nx^{n-1}\]</span> If this is true, it’d make our lives a lot easier. We wouldn’t have to go through that unpleasant Fermat’s Difference Quotient rigamarole every time we want to take a derivative—we could just apply this formula. But is it true? <em>We need to prove it.</em></p>
<p>To prove it, we’d need to expand <span class="math inline">\((x+h)^n\)</span>, for any/every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. That’s a little weird. How do we multiply something out not <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, or some specific number of times, but <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times? That’s the crux. The key is to use this idea called the <strong>binomial theorem</strong> (and relatedly, <strong>Pascal’s Triangle</strong>), which gives us a formula for all the terms of something like that: <span class="math display">\[(a+b)^n \,=\, \sum_{k=0}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}a^{n-k}b^{k} \]</span> In this case, instead of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. And to actually work things out, we have to break up the sum a bit, and extract the <span class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span> terms. (You might remember that we did stuff like this in the fall when we were talking about infinite series. Likewise, hopefully you remember the binomial theorem from Math 2!)</p>
<p>I want to explain this proof in three ways, of increasing rigor. (Like doing three different attempts at a painting, and with the painting getting better each time!)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, let’s quickly run through calculating the derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(x^5\)</span>, doing every step simultaneously, so we can see what’s the same and what’s different about doing it for each power.</li>
<li>Then, let’s try to generalize to the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> in a hand-wavey sort of way.</li>
<li>Finally, let’s do the full formal rigorous proof, using the binomial theorem.</li>
</ol>
<p>My hope is that this way we can <em>understand</em> what’s going on. The big scary binomial theorem will then just be a formalization of our existing understanding and intuition. As always in math, our goal is <em>understanding</em>—not mindless symbol-manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="way-1-a-bunch-of-specific-examples-color-coded">Way #1: A bunch of specific examples, color-coded</h2>
<p>Let’s calculate the derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(x^5\)</span>. If we plug <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x^5\)</span> into Fermat’s Difference Quotient, we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left(x+h\right)^2 - x^2}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left(  x+h\right)^3 - x^3}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left(x+h\right)^4 - x^4}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( x+h\right)^5 - x^5}{h}\]</span> Then we can expand the <span class="math inline">\((x+h)^n\)</span>. I’ll add some colors to help distinguish similar parts, and help make the changes from line to line clearer. If we expand those powers—and I’m definitely not showing all the work—we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( x^2 + {\color{blue}2xh} {\color{red} + h^2}\right) - x^2}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left(  x^3 + {\color{blue}3x^2h} {\color{red}+ 3xh^2 + h^3}\right) - x^3}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( x^4 + {\color{blue}4x^3h }{\color{red}+ 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4}\right) - x^4}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( x^5 + {\color{blue}5x^4h }{\color{red}+ 10x^3h^2 + 10x^2h^3 + 5xh^4 + h^5}\right) - x^5}{h}\]</span> So I’m coloring the highest power of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>, in black, the next-highest power, <span class="math inline">\(x^{n-1}\)</span>, in blue, and all the smaller powers in red. Then we can cancel out the <span class="math inline">\(+x^n\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(-x^n\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( \cancel{x^2} + {\color{blue}2xh} {\color{red} + h^2}\right) - \cancel{x^2}}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left(  \cancel{x^3} + {\color{blue}3x^2h} {\color{red}+ 3xh^2 + h^3}\right) - \cancel{x^3}}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( \cancel{x^4} + {\color{blue}4x^3h }{\color{red}+ 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4}\right) - \cancel{x^4}}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left( \cancel{x^5} + {\color{blue}5x^4h }{\color{red}+ 10x^3h^2 + 10x^2h^3 + 5xh^4 + h^5}\right) - \cancel{x^5}}{h}\]</span> So we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}2xh} {\color{red} + h^2} }{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}3x^2h} {\color{red}+ 3xh^2 + h^3} }{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}4x^3h }{\color{red}+ 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4} }{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}5x^4h }{\color{red}+ 10x^3h^2 + 10x^2h^3 + 5xh^4 + h^5} }{h}\]</span> Then we can divide the <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>’s: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}2x\cancel{h}} {\color{red} + \cancel{h}^2} }{\cancel{h}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}3x^2\cancel{h}} {\color{red}+ 3x\cancel{h}^2 + \cancel{h}^3} }{\cancel{h}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}4x^3\cancel{h} }{\color{red}+ 6x^2\cancel{h}^2 + 4x\cancel{h}^3 + \cancel{h}^4} }{\cancel{h}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}5x^4\cancel{h} }{\color{red}+ 10x^3\cancel{h}^2 + 10x^2\cancel{h}^3 + 5x\cancel{h}^4 + \cancel{h}^5 }}{\cancel{h}}\]</span> So we get: <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue}2x} {\color{red} + h} \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue}3x^2} {\color{red}+ 3xh + h^2} \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue}4x^3 }{\color{red}+ 6x^2h + 4xh^2 + h^3} \]</span> <span class="math display">\[{\color{blue}5x^4 }{\color{red}+ 10x^3h + 10x^2h^2 + 5xh^3 +h^4 } \]</span> And then, if we make <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> go to zero, we can just get: <span class="math display">\[{\color{blue}2x}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue}3x^2}  \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue}4x^3 } \]</span> <span class="math display">\[{\color{blue}5x^4 } \]</span> So, that’s how we find the derivative/slope of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x^5\)</span>, respectively. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\left(x^2\right)&#39; &amp;= {\color{blue}2x} \\
\left(x^3\right)&#39; &amp;= {\color{blue}3x^2}  \\
\left(x^4\right)&#39; &amp;= {\color{blue}4x^3 } \\
\left(x^5\right)&#39; &amp;= {\color{blue}5x^4 } 
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="way-2-somewhat-generalized-but-still-hand-wavey">Way #2: Somewhat generalized, but still hand-wavey</h2>
<p>The thing is, these are just four examples. If we want to prove that this formula is true for <em>all</em> <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we can’t just do a bunch of examples. We have to actually calculate the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>!</p>
<p>So in general, if we plug <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> into Fermat’s Difference Quotient, we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}\]</span> Then if we expand <span class="math inline">\((x+h)^n\)</span>, we get something like: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\left(x^n \,+\, {\color{blue}nx^{n-1}h} \,+\, \left({\color{red}\substack{\text{a bunch of cross terms}\\\text{with $x$&#39;s and $h$&#39;s}}}\right)\,\right) -x^n}{h}\]</span> We could use the binomial theorem to actually find out what those cross terms are, but those are the terms that have an <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in them and will eventually all just go to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, so we’ll leave them like that. Note that I’m deliberately keeping the same color-coding, in case you want to compare to the previous iteration of this proof.</p>
<p>Canceling out the <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>s, we have: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\cancel{x^n} + {\color{blue}nx^{n-1}h} + {\color{red} \text{ (a bunch of cross terms with $x$&#39;s and $h$&#39;s)}} -\cancel{x^n}}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}nx^{n-1}h} + {\color{red} \text{ (a bunch of cross terms with $x$&#39;s and $h$&#39;s)}}}{h}\]</span> Dividing through the <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue}nx^{n-1}\cancel{h}} + {\color{red} \text{ (a bunch of cross terms with $x$&#39;s and $\cancel{h}$&#39;s)} }}{\cancel{h}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue}nx^{n-1}} + {\color{red} \text{ (a bunch of cross terms with $x$&#39;s and $h$&#39;s, but with the $h$ power down by $1$) }} \]</span> So then as <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> goes to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, this just turns into: <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue}nx^{n-1}}\]</span> Hooray! We’ve gotten to <span class="math inline">\(nx^{n-1}\)</span>!</p>
<h2 id="way-3-the-big-serious-proof-with-lots-of-scary-symbols">Way #3: The big serious proof, with lots of scary symbols</h2>
<p>Okay, let’s do this for real! Let’s do the same proof we just did—but instead of hand-waving and including things like “a bunch of cross terms with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>’s,” let’s do it really formally.</p>
<p>What, exactly, are those “cross terms with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>’s”? Using the <strong>binomial theorem</strong>, we can figure them out! You may remember learning it last year when you studied combinatorics in Math 2. The binomial theorem tells us how to combine things: <span class="math display">\[(a+b)^n \,=\, \sum_{k=0}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}a^{n-k}b^{k} \]</span> So, if instead of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, this becomes: <span class="math display">\[(x+h)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k}\]</span> Now, this looks very scary. There’s a giant Greek letter in the middle of the page. But it’s not scary. All we’re going to do in this proof is do <em>the same thing</em> we did to find the derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x^5\)</span>. The only difference is that we’re going to use a slightly fancier tool—a giant <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> rather than normal arithmetic.</p>
<p>It is the difference between using a hammer to crush a small stone, and using a jackhammer to tear apart asphalt. The jackhammer looks huge and expensive and scary, and it runs on gasoline, not adenosine triphosphate, and you have to borrow it from your cousin in the demolition business. But in principle, it is no different than the hammer. It operates by exactly the same mechanism: hitting things with a blunt object. It is the same with the binomial theorem: it looks different, but it’s really just the same thing. There are some extra things we need to do as a result of its presence (get a permit, fill it with gas, put on safety glasses, etc.) but the core idea of the proof is identical. We are going to expand <span class="math inline">\((x+h)^n\)</span>, simplify it, cancel <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>’s out, and then send <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> to zero.</p>
<p>So, let’s start. If we plug <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> into Fermat’s Difference Quotient, we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ \left( x+h \right)^n - x^n}{h}\]</span> Then if we expand <span class="math inline">\((x+h)^n\)</span> using the binomial theorem, we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ \left( \sum\limits_{k=0}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} \right) - x^n}{h}\]</span> We want to do the same thing we’ve done in the previous versions of the proof. We want to have the <span class="math inline">\(+x^n\)</span> cancel out with the <span class="math inline">\(-x^n\)</span>. But we don’t have an <span class="math inline">\(+x^n\)</span> here. We just have this big giant scary binomial theorem. Yet, within that big giant scary binomial theorem is contained a <span class="math inline">\(+x^n\)</span>! It’s the first term, i.e., the <span class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span> term. We’ll have to extract it so that we can see it. We have: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ \left( \overbrace{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} }^{\text{the terms from $k=0$ to $k=n$}}\right) - x^n}{h}\]</span> Pulling out the <span class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span> term, we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ \left( \overbrace{{n\choose {n-0}}x^{n-0}h^{0} }^{\text{the $k=0$ term}} \,\,+ \overbrace{ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} }^{\text{the terms from $k=1$ to $k=n$}}\right) - x^n}{h}\]</span> Simplifying this a bit, we have: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ \overbrace{{n\choose {n}}x^{n} }^{\text{the $k=0$ term}} \,\,+ \overbrace{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} }^{\text{the terms from $k=1$ to $k=n$}} \quad-\quad x^n}{h}\]</span> What’s <span class="math inline">\(n\choose n\)</span>? It’s just the number of ways to select <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> things from a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> things. There’s only one way! So this becomes: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ x^{n} \,\,+ \overbrace{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} }^{\text{the terms from $k=1$ to $k=n$}} \quad-\quad x^n}{h}\]</span> Yay! There’s our <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>. Before we cancel it out with the <span class="math inline">\(-x^n\)</span>, let’s pull out the <span class="math inline">\(nx^{n-1}\)</span> term, too. That’s the term that we ultimately want to be the last thing standing at the end of the proof—that’s the derivative. The <span class="math inline">\(nx^{n-1}\)</span> will come out of the <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span> term, so let’s pull that out. And then we can color things the same way we were coloring them before! (I attempted to use blue and gold, the California state color scheme, but the gold/yellow was completely illegible.) If we extract the <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span> term from the sum, we have: <span class="math display">\[\displaystyle \frac{ \overbrace{x^{n}}^{\text{the $k=0$ term}} + \overbrace{ {\color{blue} {n\choose {n-1}}x^{n-1}h^{1}} }^{\text{the $k=1$ term}} \,\,+ \overbrace{ {\color{red} \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} } }^{\text{the terms from $k=2$ to $k=n$}} \quad-\quad x^n}{h}\]</span> Just to summarize what we have so far: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ \overbrace{\left( x^{n} +  {\color{blue} {n\choose {n-1}}x^{n-1}h^{1}}  \,\,+  {\color{red} \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} } \right)}^{=(x+h)^n\text{, but expanded}}\quad-\quad x^n}{h}\]</span> Let’s simplify this a bit. <span class="math inline">\(h^1\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. What about <span class="math inline">\({n\choose {n-1}}\)</span>? That’s just the number of ways we can pick <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> things from a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> things. There are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> ways we systematically exclude each thing. So this becomes: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ x^{n} + {\color{blue} nx^{n-1}h } \,\,+ \overbrace{ {\color{red}  \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} } }^{\text{the terms from $k=2$ to $k=n$}} - x^n}{h}\]</span> Yay, there’s <span class="math inline">\(nx^{n-1}\)</span>!!! Now we can cancel out the <span class="math inline">\(+x^n\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(-x^n\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ \cancel{x^{n}} + {\color{blue} nx^{n-1}h} \,\,+{\color{red} \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} }- \cancel{x^n}}{h}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue} nx^{n-1}h} \,\,+{\color{red} \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k} } } {h}\]</span> And we can divide through the <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{ {\color{blue} nx^{n-1}\cancel{h}} \,\,+{\color{red} \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}\cancel{h}^{k} } } {\cancel{h}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue} nx^{n-1} } \,\,+{\color{red} \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}h^{k-1} }  \]</span> What happens as <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> goes to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>? Well, there’s no <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(nx^{n-1}\)</span>, so that doesn’t change. But there’s always an <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in that big sum. We have <span class="math inline">\(h^{k-1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> starts at <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, so there’s always at least one <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. So this becomes: <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue} nx^{n-1} } \,\,+\underbrace{{\color{red} \sum\limits_{k=2}^{k=n}{n\choose {n-k}}x^{n-k}0^{k-1} }}_{\text{so all this $=0$}}  \]</span> So we have just: <span class="math display">\[ {\color{blue} nx^{n-1} } \]</span> Yes! That’s it! We’ve proven it!!!! <span class="math display">\[\boxed{\Large \,\, \left(x^n\right)&#39; = nx^{n-1} \,\, }\]</span> So, there we have it. This is a long proof! It requires a lot of familiarity and flexibility with iterated sums, as well as familiarity with the binomial theorem.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>OK, by “problem” here I mean both “a problem for you to do,” <em>and</em> “a problem with the proof we just did!”</p>
<p>Here’s the issue. To be pedantic, we didn’t calculate the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> being any real number. We didn’t discuss what kind of number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> was. Was <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> real? Was it an integer? Was it rational? Imaginary? We just blazed through that part. (<strong>Implicit typing</strong>, the computer scientists would say.) imaginary, integer, rational—we just, like, blazed through it.</p>
<p>Thinking about what we did with more nuance, we only proved that <span class="math inline">\(\left(x^n\right)&#39; = nx^{n-1}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is some positive integer. That’s because we used the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem is only true for positive integers. It’s a theorem about <em>counting</em> and <em>combinations</em>—it’s a theorem about <em>positive integers</em>. But actually, we’d like to prove this for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> being also a negative integer (what’s the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^{-1}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(1/x\)</span>?) or <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> being a fraction (what’s the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^{1/2}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span>?), or even for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> being an irrational number (what’s the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x^\pi\)</span>?).</p>
<p>This theorem <em>is</em> true for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> being any real number. But actually proving that is tough. There’s a really pretty, and extremely simple proof that proves this for any real number—but it involves the derivatives of logarithms of exponentials, and we definitely don’t know how to do that yet!</p>
<p>However, we <em>can</em> at least prove it right now, for <em>negative</em> integers. Perhaps we can generalize our binomial-theorem-based proof to negative values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>?</p>
<p>Imagine that we want to prove this: <span class="math display">\[\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\left( x^n\right) = nx^{n-1},\quad\quad \text{ for negative integer $n$}\]</span> This is the same as proving: <span class="math display">\[\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{x^n}\right) = \frac{-n}{x^{n+1}} = -nx^{-n-1},\quad\quad \text{ for positive integer $n$}\]</span> And that seems like something we might know how to do! If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is now a positive integer, we can use the binomial theorem. So, by the definition of a derivative, the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(1/x^n\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{x^n}\right) =  \frac{\,\,\frac{1}{(x+h)^n} - \frac{1}{x^n}\,\,}{h}\]</span> which, plugging in the binomial theorem, is <span class="math display">\[\large =\quad \displaystyle\frac{\quad\quad \displaystyle\frac{1}{\quad \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{k=n}  {n \choose n-k}x^{n-k}h^{k}\quad} \,\,-\,\, \displaystyle\frac{1}{\quad x^n\quad} \quad\quad }{\huge h}\]</span> Can you keep going, and finish this proof??? It’ll get messy—<em>fractions</em>, man—but you can do it!</p>
<p>When your relatives ask during Thanksgiving dinner what you’re doing in school (“What grade are you in now? 9th?”), you can pause for a moment, as if to wonder how to explain your work to the laity, and then say, “I’m trying to use the binomial theorem to differentiate <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> for negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.” And you will sound like a graduate-student-in-the-making.</p>
<p>If you do write it up, please take the time to write it up <em>nicely</em>—don’t hand in a paper full of scratch work. Use sentences, explain your methodology, and justify each of your steps in both English prose and in mathematical symbols.</p>
