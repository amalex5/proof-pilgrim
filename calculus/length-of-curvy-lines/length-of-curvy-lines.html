<blockquote>
<p><em>This is a bit of a digression. We’re actually going to start the year by doing a lot of</em> not<em>-calculus. In order to do calculus in higher dimensions, we first need to learn how to live in the higher-dimensional world. That’s what we’re going to spend the first few months of this class doing—learning a hacky, quick-and-dirty version of <strong>linear algebra</strong>, as the fundamental tool we use to do higher-dimensional calculus with. But, because this</em> is <em>a calculus class, I wanted to start us off with some calculus! This is a fun derivation in one-dimensional calculus that you probably haven’t seen before, and a lot of the ideas that come up foreshadow some big themes in MVC.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long are curvy lines? We know how to find the slopes of curvy lines. We know how to find the areas beneath curvy lines. But how do we find the <em>lengths</em> of curvy lines???</p>
<p>Let’s think about our favorite function: a parabola! <img src="arc-length-parabola-1.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> How long is this parabola? Okay, dumb question. Obviously it’s infinitely long. It’s going from <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>. But what if we just think about a finite segment of it? Consider the chunk of this parabola from <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span>. How long is it?!?! <img src="arc-length-parabola-2.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> If we were to take a piece of string, and place it perfectly parallel to every point on that parabola, how long of a piece of string would we need?</p>
<div style="height:2em">

</div>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<div style="height:2em">

</div>
<p>If it were a straight line, we could just make a triangle, a/k/a use the Pythagorean Theorem. But it’s not a straight line.</p>
<div style="height:2em">

</div>
<p>OK. Not sure what to do.</p>
<div style="height:2em">

</div>
<p>The distance in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-direction is <span class="math inline">\(5-1=4\)</span>. So the length of the parabola must be longer than that. (Fancy word: the distance of its <strong>projection</strong> along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis is <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>.) Likewise, its distance in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-direction is <span class="math inline">\(5^2-1^2=24\)</span>. So the length must be longer than that. (Same fancy word: the distance of its projection onto the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis is <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span>.) But “longer than <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span>” isn’t that specific.</p>
<p>I guess we could think of this as being like a triangle. If we plop a triangle down on top if it, we could maybe get a better approximation for how long the parabola is? <img src="arc-length-parabola-3.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> The relevant vertices of the triangle are <span class="math inline">\((1, 1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((5,25)\)</span>, so if we find the length/distance between them, we’ll get: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    \text{length} &amp;= \sqrt{(25-1)^2 - (5-1)^2} \\
    &amp;= \sqrt{24^2 + 4^2} \\
    &amp;= \sqrt{592} \\
    &amp;= 24.3311\dots
\end{align*}\]</span> <img src="arc-length-parabola-4.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> Of course, that’s not the length of the parabola. It’s probably <em>close</em> to the length. But parabolas are curvy! Triangles are straight! This is just an approximation! How can we get a better approximation? Can we get a <em>perfect</em> approximation? Maybe we could use a <em>lot</em> of tiny triangles!!!</p>
<p>Here’s another idea. (Or rather, a different approach to the same idea: “approximating the length with an infinite number of tiny triangles” is, in fact, exactly how we’ll figure this out.) Let’s zoom in really, really, really close to this parabola. If we zoom in infinitely close, <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, like any line, no matter how curvy, <em>will look like a straight line</em>: <img src="arc-length-differential-1.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> So we’ve zoomed in infinitely far, and now <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span> just looks like a straight line. We can go an infinitely-tiny amount <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-direction, and then <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span> will go up by an infinitely-tiny amount <span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-direction: <img src="arc-length-differential-2.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> This is just like how when we’re not infinitely-zoomed-in, we can go some distance in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-direction, and the curve will move some distance in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-direction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span>—i.e., the length of the curve itself—will move some infinitely-tiny length. Let’s label that as <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span>: <img src="arc-length-differential-3.svg" style="width:50.0%" /> But because this is just a straight line, we just have a right triangle here, and so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to figure it out! We have just: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    (dr)^2 &amp;= (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 \\
    dr &amp;= \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 }
\end{align*}\]</span> WAIT. Hold on a second. What’s going on here? What do I mean by “infinitely-tiny length”? Isn’t that be the same as <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>? Why did I label them as “<span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>” and “<span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span>”? Does that have any connection to the Leibniz notation of a derivative, <span class="math inline">\(dy/dx\)</span>??</p>
<p>OK, guys… we’re getting back to the <em>core conceptual weirdness</em> at the heart of calculus. “`Weirdness” isn’t even a strong enough word. We’re getting back to the <em>core contradiction</em> at the heart of calculus. (And, more fundamentally, at the heart of the real numbers.) Namely: <em>how can things be infinitely close to zero, and yet not equal to zero?</em> How can we have a slope <em>at a single point</em>? How can we add up an infinite number of infinitely-narrow rectangles, and yet somehow get a (non-zero, non-infinite) area? This is the deep strangeness at the heart of calculus (and, equivalently, the real numbers). Ultimately, stuff like the epsilon-delta proofs you learned how to do last year are what (in some sense) resolves (“resolves”) this conflict. But it took two hundred years from the time calculus was invented before people were reasonably confident that calculus wasn’t, fundamentally, a pile of malarkey. (After all, you all remember the seventh grade proof that <span class="math inline">\(0.\overline{9}=1\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Does this make any sense? Because <em>it shouldn’t</em>. It took the smartest people in the world hundreds of years to even begin to get a handle on it.</p>
<p>Anyway. So, here, <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span> are quantities that are a) infinitely close to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, but b) not so infinitely-close to zero that they actually are zero. And there will indeed be a surprising connections to derviatives in a bit!</p>
<p>But first, let’s bash through some algebra. Our goal here is that we want to find the infinitely-tiny length of an infinitely-tiny piece of the parabola <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span>, and then add up all infinity of the infinitely-tiny lengths of <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span>! That’s the plan.</p>
<p>But there’s a bunch of irritating algebra we need to do to make that a viable strategy. So far, we have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    (dr)^2 &amp;= (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 \\
    dr &amp;= \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 }
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This isn’t helpful, because we don’t really know what <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span> are. They’re just “an infinitely-tiny distance in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-direction” and “an infinitely-tiny distance in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-direction,” respectively. So, let’s do an algebra trick! We’ll do one of the tricks where you multiply something by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, but a <em>special kind</em> of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. In particular, we’ll multiply all this by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dx}{dx}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2}\cdot \underbrace{\frac{dx}{dx}}_{=1} 
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>We know that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dx}{dx}\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, so we can multiply random things by it without actually changing anything. Next, we’re going to split <em>part</em> of that fraction up, and move <em>part</em> of it inside the square root (but not all of it):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2} \cdot\left( \frac{1}{dx} \cdot dx\right) \\
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{dx} \cdot dx 
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>We’ll move the <span class="math inline">\(1/dx\)</span> part inside the square root. But to do so, we need to simultaneously square-and-square-root it:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2} \cdot \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{dx}\right)^2} \, \cdot dx
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>We’re not actually changing anything, since we’re square-rooting a square, but doing so lets us combine the square roots, and then bring <span class="math inline">\(1/dx\)</span> inside:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ \bigg( (dx)^2 + (dy)^2\bigg) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{dx}\right)^2 } \,\cdot dx\\
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ \bigg( (dx)^2 + (dy)^2\bigg) \cdot \frac{1}{(dx)^2} } \,\cdot dx
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Then we can distribute things:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ (dx)^2\cdot\frac{1}{(dx)^2}  + (dy)^2\cdot\frac{1}{(dx)^2}  }\, \cdot dx \\
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ \frac{(dx)^2}{(dx)^2}  + \frac{(dy)^2}{(dx)^2}  }\, \cdot dx
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Some stuff cancels:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{(dy)^2}{(dx)^2}  }\, dx
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s clean it up a bit:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dr &amp;= \sqrt{ 1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2  }\, dx
\end{align*}\]</span> And, golly gee, look at that!!! We have a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span> in there! Is that a derivative? It is!!! We went from this magical “<span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>” and “<span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span>” into a derivative! (And since we’re talking about a parabola here, we know what its derivative is.) This seems like a lot of voodoo and hocus-pocus with notation—and it sort of is—but also—it works!!! You should be suspicious—you shouldn’t totally trust this—but—just bear with me for a bit.</p>
<p>In this particular case, we have the parabola <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span>, so we know what its derivative is, and we can plug that in: <span class="math display">\[y=x^2 \quad\implies\quad \frac{dy}{dx}=2x\]</span> Then the infinitely-small “length” of a parabola curve, at the point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\substack{\text{the infinitely-small length}\\\text{of the parabola $y=x^2$}\\\text{at an $x$-value of $x$}} =\, dr \,&amp;= \sqrt{ 1 + \left(2x\right)^2  }\, dx \\
&amp;= \sqrt{ 1 + 4x^2  }\, dx 
\end{align*}\]</span> So, we just need to add up all the infinitely-small lengths between <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span>. No problem! We’ll find the infinitely-small length when <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>, and when <span class="math inline">\(x=1.1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x=1.01\)</span>, and I guess we’ll need <span class="math inline">\(x=1.001\)</span>, too, and all the other numbers between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>! And then we’ll just add them up! Which… oh, darn. How many numbers are there between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>? There are <em>infinity</em> of them. <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\substack{\text{the total length}\\\text{of the parabola $y=x^2$}\\\text{between $x=1$ and $x=5$}} \,=\, &amp;\,\,\sqrt{ 1 +4\cdot \left(1 \right)^2  }\, dx \\
&amp;+ \sqrt{ 1 +4\cdot \left(1.1 \right)^2  }\, dx \\
&amp;+ \sqrt{ 1 +4\cdot \left(1.01 \right)^2  }\, dx \\
&amp;+ \sqrt{ 1 +4\cdot \left(1.001 \right)^2  }\, dx \\
&amp;+ \sqrt{ 1 +4\cdot \left(\substack{\text{ALL THE OTHER REAL NUMBERS}\\\text{BETWEEN $1$ AND $5$}} \right)^2  }\, dx \\
&amp;\quad\vdots
\end{align*}\]</span> Okay, this is obviously a problem.</p>
<p>Among the reasons it’s a problem is that the real numbers are <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=countability+of+the+reals">uncountable</a></strong>—meaning that even if we wanted to write them in an infinitely-long list, we couldn’t. We can write the integers in an infinitely-long list: <span class="math display">\[1, 2, 3, \cdots,  n, \cdots\]</span> But there’s no way to do this for the reals. (This was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=uncountability+of+the+reals">originally proved by Cantor</a>.)</p>
<p>But even before all that, there’s the more fundamental issue that we’re adding up an infinite amount of things. How do we do that?!?</p>
<p>That part is easy! That’s what an integral is! An integral is a way to add up an infinitely-large number of infinitely-small things, and get some normal finite number! You did this a million times last year!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\substack{\text{the total length}\\\text{of the parabola $y=x^2$}\\\text{between $x=1$ and $x=5$}} \quad&amp;=\quad \substack{\text{add up all the }\\\text{infinitely-small lengths}}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Phrasing this as an integral, it’s just: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= \int \text{all the infinitely-small lengths}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>We gave the label <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span> to our infinitely-small lengths:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= \int dr
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>And we worked out an equation for <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span>, so we’ll plug that in:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= \int \sqrt{ 1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2  }\, dx
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>For the parabola <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span>, this becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= \int \sqrt{ 1 + 4x^2  }\, dx
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Of course, it’s not <em>all</em> the infinitely-small lengths we want to add up; it’s just the ones between <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span>. But integrals already give us a way of dealing with that!!! We just integrate from <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= \int_1^5 \sqrt{ 1 + 4x^2  }\, dx 
\end{align*}\]</span> Okay, now we have yet another problem. Namely: we don’t know how to antidifferentiate that. If it looked like <span class="math inline">\(x\sqrt{1+4x^2}\)</span> we could use the chain rule, but there’s no extra <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> hanging around. Hmm. What to do?</p>
<p>Um, okay, don’t tell anyone I’m doing this: <img src="wolfram-alpha-arc-length-antiderivative-calculation.png" /> Huh. Okay, yeah, I definitely couldn’t have figured that out myself. There’s an inverse hyperbolic sine involved!!! What does that even mean??? <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions">Hyperbolic trig functions</a></strong> are really cool—you know how normal trig functions are, like, points on a circle? Hyperbolic trig functions are <em>points on a hyperbola</em>. But, anyway, even though it’s antidifferentiable, that’s clearly not an antiderivative that any of us would have known.</p>
<p>To actually figure out the length of this parabola, we’ll integrate the full thing: <img src="wolfram-alpha-arc-length-integral-calculation.png" /> Wolfram Alpha is based on Mathematica, a powerful computer algebra system/programming language/IDE. Nueva has a site license for it if you want to try it out. (Leonard sometimes uses it in his classes.) We also have a site license for Matlab, which is a competing computer algebra system. (Ted prefers Matlab.) I use Sage, which is an open-source computer algebra system—it’s a Python superset that wraps together a bunch of helpful libraries (<code>NumPy</code>, <code>SymPy</code>, etc.) into a single package. In Sage, I’d calculate the antiderivative like so:</p>
<pre>
from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import indefinite_integral
    indefinite_integral(
        sqrt( 1 + 4*x^2 ),
        x
    )

> 1/2*sqrt(4*x^2 + 1)*x + 1/4*arcsinh(2*x)
</pre>
<p>And then to actually evaluate it, I’d calculate:</p>
<pre>
from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import definite_integral
definite_integral( 
    sqrt( 1 + 4*x^2 ),
    x,
    1,
    5
 )
 
> 5/2*sqrt(101) - 1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/4*arcsinh(10) - 1/4*arcsinh(2)
</pre>
<p>We can get a numerical approximation by the calling the <code>numerical_approximation()</code> method on it, abbreviated with just <code>n()</code>:</p>
<pre>
definite_integral( 
    sqrt( 1 + 4*x^2 ),
    x,
    1,
    5
 ).n(digits=6)
 
> 24.3953
</pre>
<p>I like Sage, because it’s just Python, and so it’s easily programmable—I can have a lot of control over what’s going on, and compose things into larger programs. You can do that in Mathematica or Matlab, too, but Python is a language I already know and use for other purposes. Plus, Sage/Python is free and open-source, unlike Mathematica and Matlab. The advantage with Wolfram Alpha, though, is that it accepts input in natural language, so it can be very easy to quickly do a one-off calculation!</p>
<p>Anyway, how ’bout that answer?!?! <span class="math display">\[\substack{\text{the total length}\\\text{of the parabola $y=x^2$}\\\text{between $x=1$ and $x=5$}} \quad\approx\quad \ 24.3953\]</span> It’s a little bit disappointing. The length of a straight line between <span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((5,25)\)</span>, as we figured out, is just <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{592}\approx 24.3311\)</span>. So a parabola is only <em>slightly</em> longer. Parabolas aren’t very curvy! I guess that’s the lesson here. (Maybe I should have chosen a more exciting example.)</p>
<div style="height:3em;">

</div>
<p>Of course, there’s a more general lesson here as well. Namely, we now have a formula for the length of a curvy line:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{\substack{\text{the total length}\\\text{of the curve $y=f(x)$}\\\text{between $x=x_1$ and $x=x_2$}} \quad=\quad \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{ 1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2  }\, dx}\]</span></p>
<p>It’s a formula that involves a derivative <em>and</em> an integral—what fun!</p>
<div style="height:3em;">

</div>
<p>Some vocab: the quantity <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span>—the infinitely-tiny distance along the curve—usually gets called the <strong>differential arc length</strong>, or the <strong>differential curve length</strong>. Sometimes people call it the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_element">line element</a></strong>, especially if you’re talking about fancier stuff. The two-dimensional analogue is the <strong>surface element</strong> (an infinitely-tiny two-dimensional area); the three-dimensional analogue is the <strong>volume element</strong> (an infinitely-tiny volume). In general this process (in 2D) gets called finding the <strong>arc length</strong> of a curve, or something like that.</p>
<div style="height:3em;">

</div>
Also: I wanted to do this construction with you guys right now, at the beginning of the year, less for its own sake (although it is a cool formula, and it is something we’ll use again), and more because it foreshadows some big themes in MVC. Namely:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Integrals are hard.</strong> Sometimes they’re easy. Sometimes they’re dreadful. Analogously, think of division and logarithmancy:
<ul>
<li>
We can easily calculate <span class="math inline">\(10/5\)</span> by hand, but not <span class="math inline">\(10/7\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
We can easily calculate <span class="math inline">\(\log_{2}(32)\)</span> by hand, but not <span class="math inline">\(\log_2(33)\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
Likewise with integrals. Integration is a <em>messy</em> operation. We’ve got to put on our gloves. Sometimes integrals are nice… other times, we’ll have to use our silicon friends.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Differentials and their ambiguous ontology</strong>. Maybe <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dy\)</span> aren’t just bits of notation that we toss into derivatives and integrals… maybe they’re actual <em>numbers</em>, or actual <em>mathematical objects</em> that we can play with just like we can play with all our other mathematical objects!
</ul>

<p>OK, it’s kinda plug-and-chug, but, uh, figure out the length of the following curves (and do so <em>without a calculator</em>, unless you absolutely can’t, in which case you can use a technological tool, so long as you feel guilty about it).</p>

The length of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=e^x\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>. <!-- hard but cool? parts??? good review of integration -->

Let’s think a bit more about the parabola <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span>. Its average slope between <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\text{change in $y$}}{\text{change in $x$}} =  \frac{25-1}{5-1} = \frac{24}{4}  = 6\]</span> But it doesn’t have a slope of <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> the entire time between <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span>. It’s curvy! At first, the parabola is shallower; at the end, it’s steeper. At first, the slope is less than six; at the end, it’s greater than six. But at some point in between, the parabola will have a slope of exactly <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>! Where?

How <em>curvy</em> are curvy lines??? We can measure the lengths of curvy lines; we can measure the slopes of curvy lines… what if we want to somehow come up with a measurement of the <em>curviness</em> of a line?
