<p>We do things. We undo things.</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>We do things. We don’t things.</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>Often in our class we elide<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the distinction between a <strong>function</strong> and a <strong>curve</strong>. For example, we can conceptualize a parabola as being this nice, lovely, one-dimensional curve, twirling through two-dimensional space:</p>
<p><img src="x%5E2.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>We can also conceptualize it as a function. Thought of as a function, it’s a machine that takes in some input and spits out some output. In the case of a parabola, we take some input, square it, and spit that out:</p>
<p><img src="x%5E2-as-function.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>This might seem like a distinction without a difference. In our class, it mostly is. We care about curves <em>qua</em> curves. We want to understand curves and shapes; functions are merely a way of describing and interacting with them.</p>
<p>But it’s worth lingering, momentarily, on this idea of a <strong>function</strong>. You learn the definition in middle school. People talk about a function as a “machine” that transforms some input into some output. That description seems so simple and trite as to be uninteresting. But… actually, there’s a lot there. It’s deeper and more meaningful than it appears. Functions, see, are <strong>modular</strong>. They don’t exist in isolation. They’re not lonely atoms bouncing around the vacancy of interstellar space. Rather, we can <em>link them up</em>. We can snap them together, like Legos, and create more complicated functions. We can start with simple machines, and put them together to make more complicated machines.</p>
<p>Think of a really, really complicated machine. An airplane, or an Amazon distribution center, or an operating system. No one can hold the entirety of something that complicated in their heads. But if we can design <em>pieces</em> of a machine, and if we’re confident that each individual piece will do what it says it’ll do—that it’ll take its input, and return the thing we want—then we can, piece by piece, build complexity that’s <em>beautiful</em> and <em>powerful</em> and <em>deep</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So… simplicity, yes, but in that simplicity <em>beauty</em>, not banality.</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>That’s all hand-wavey abstraction! Let’s get more concrete. The word people use for “snapping together two functions like Legos” is <strong>composition</strong>. We can <strong>compose</strong> two functions together and get a new function. For example, suppose we have the functions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = 3x^2 \hspace{1cm} \text{and} \hspace{1cm} g(x) = 5x + 1\]</span></p>
<p>Then we can plug <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and get a third function, a new function, which I’ll call <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
h(x) = g\Big(\,f(x)\,\Big) &amp; = 5\Big(\,f(x)\,\Big) + 1 \\
&amp;= 5\Big(\, 3x^2 \,\Big) + 1
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Actually, the stuff with the parentheses is the standard notation for functions, but I’ve never been a huge fan of it. I mean, I use it, and we need to, because everyone else does, but if we’re thinking about <em>functions qua functions</em>, I think it’s better to emphasize their take-some-input-vomit-some-output personality by writing them with arrows, like this:</p>
<p><img src="functions-f-and-g.svg" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>The order makes more sense this way—it’s subject-verb-object, whereas “<span class="math inline">\(f(x)=\text{blah}\)</span>” is verb-subject-object. English is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order">SVO language</a>, so let’s not randomly drop into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object_word_order">VSO</a>!</p>
<p>Plus, if you write them like this, then it’s easy to compose them—just line them up next to each other! Like Legos!!!</p>
<p>The composition of these two functions, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, is:</p>
<p><img src="function-h.svg" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>Note that when we’re composing functions, the order matters! Doing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> first and then <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is very different from doing <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> first and then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="function-g-then-f.svg" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>Or, in the standard, less-visual notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
f\Big(\,g(x)\,\Big) &amp; = 3\Big(\,g(x)\,\Big)^2 \\
&amp;= 3\Big(\, 5x+1 \,\Big)^2
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>In our class, we usually mean the “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>” in a function to represent the position along the horizontal axis of a coordinate plane. But if we’re thinking about functions more generally (functions <em>qua</em> functions), “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>” is just a “placeholder”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that can stand for anything. For instance, these four functions are all written with different placeholders, but they all describe the same underlying function, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{x^2}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(t) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{t^2}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(\text{Patrick}) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{(\text{Patrick})^2}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(\zeta) = 1/\zeta^2\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of plugging <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or Patrick into <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, why not replace the placeholder with an entire function? This is the essence of composition.</p>
<p>(That fun frightening symbol in the last example is a lower-case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta">zeta</a>, the Greek letter cognate with our ‘z’!)</p>
<p>Composing functions, note, is exactly what we do when we do linear transformations of parent functions. We take a parent function, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, and either we plug into it a different function (to make a horizontal transformation), or we take it and plug it into a different function (to make a vertical transformation).</p>
<p>For instance, say we have the parent function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> (without knowing exactly what it is), and say we have the transformation-function <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x-3\)</span>. Then: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
f\Big(\,g(x)\,\Big) &amp;= f\Big(\, g(x) \, \Big) \\
&amp;= f(x - 3) \\
&amp;= \text{the parent function shifted right by three}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="undoing-things">Undoing things</h2>
<p>Here’s our real question right now: what if we want to <em>undo</em> the composition of functions? Think about linear transformations: if we move something right by three, we can undo that action by moving it left by three. This question is hardly restricted to functions alone. We <em>do things</em> all the time, so it’s natural to ask, can we <em>undo things</em>? If so, how?</p>

<p>For instance: if we add two things, we can undo that by subtracting, thus getting the first thing back:<span class="math display">\[A + B - B = A\]</span>If we multiply two things, we can undo that by dividing: <span class="math display">\[\displaystyle A\cdot B \cdot \frac{1}{B} = A\]</span> We usually don’t use the word “undo” to describe this operation; we usually refer to it as <strong>inverting</strong> or <strong>finding an inverse</strong>. So here’s our question: we know how to compose functions, but how do we invert that operation? How do we find an inverse for function composition? Can we?</p>
<p>Let’s do a quick example. Imagine we take something and quint it (i.e., raise it to the fifth power). How do we get the original thing back? We just take a quintic (fifth) root: <span class="math display">\[\left(x^5\right)^{1/5} = \sqrt[5]{x^5} = x\]</span> So quinting (raising something to the fifth) and taking a quintic root (taking a fifth root) are <strong>inverse functions</strong>. We know that because if we do one after the other, we get back the original thing we plugged into the equation. In this case that was just <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, but it could well have been anything. Imagine that Patrick, on a field trip to the quinting factory, accidentally fell into the quinting machine. In order to get Patrick back, you’d just need to bring him to the quintic-root factory next door: <span class="math display">\[\sqrt[5]{(\text{Patrick})^5\,\,} = \text{Patrick}\]</span> It doesn’t matter what order we compose these functions in.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\sqrt[5]{x^5} = x\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\left(\sqrt[5]{x}\right)^5 = x\]</span></p>
<div class="callout-box" style="width:75%">
<p>Suppose we have two functions, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. Then they’re <strong>inverses</strong> if and only if:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f\Big(\,g(x)\, \Big) = x\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{ and/or}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[g\Big(\, f(x) \, \Big) = x\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>In other words, they cancel each other out when we compose them. If we do one right after the other, it’s as if we’ve done <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>Often we use a special notation for inverses: if <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is some function, then we write its inverse function as <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span>. But this is bad notation. The superscript <span class="math inline">\((-1)\)</span> here has absolutely, absolutely nothing to do with a reciprocal. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{f(x)}\)</span> is <em>not</em> (with one or two uninteresting exceptions) the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. Yes, we do usually write reciprocals with a <span class="math inline">\((-1)\)</span> superscript. But here the <span class="math inline">\((-1)\)</span> just denotes an inverse. That’s why it’s horrible notation—the same symbol for two totally different things. “In the language of everyday life,” Wittgenstein writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it very often happens that the same word signifies in two different ways—and therefore belongs to two different symbols—or that two words, which signify in different ways, are apparently applied in the same way in the proposition… Thus there easily arise the most fundamental confusions. In order to avoid those errors, we must employ a symbolism which excludes them, by not applying the same sign in different symbols, and by not applying signs in the same way which signify in different ways.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite frankly, I’d rather you never use that notation at all; the only reason I’m mentioning it is because other people use it, so if you see an <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span> somewhere else in life, you’ll know what they mean. If you need a good way of writing the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, why not write <span class="math inline">\(f^{\text{inv}}(x)\)</span> instead? (That’s what I use!) Or you could come up with your own clever notation.</p>
<p>Written with my notation, this inverses-cancelling-each-other-out property looks like: <span class="math display">\[f\Big(\, f^\text{inv}(x) \, \Big) = x \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad f^\text{inv}\Big(\, f(x) \,\Big)=x\]</span></p>
<h2 id="but-how">But… how?</h2>
<p>That’s what inverses <em>are</em>. But how do we <em>find</em> them?</p>
<p>Often in life, we know what we want before we have it. We know that we’ll know what it is once we get it; we just don’t know how to get it. We know what it means to have a correct factorization of a polynomial (it’s easy to check! just multiply!), but how we come up with that factorization in the first place is more murky.</p>
<p>Patrick has fallen into the quinting machine, and we need to find (or make) an un-quinting machine <em>right now</em>. It’s <em>urgent</em>!!!</p>
<p>If we’re dealing with a function that we can also think of as a curve (that’s basically all the time for our class), the situation is actually easy: we just swap the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axes! We turn the input into the output! This corresponds to flipping/reflection the function over the line <span class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>. So, for example, suppose we have the function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x)=2x^3 + 5\]</span></p>
<p>It’s <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, but vertically stretched by <span class="math inline">\(200\%\)</span>, and moved up <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. It looks like:</p>
<p><img src="inverse-function-1.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>To draw its inverse, we need to reflect it over the line <span class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="inverse-function-2.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Giving us:</p>
<p><img src="inverse-function-3.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Yay! We’ve swapped the input for the output, thus creating the inverse. The fact that we can draw our function as a picture gives us x-ray vision for how it works as a function (as a machine), and so how we can run it in reverse!!!</p>
<p>That’s visual. What about symbolic? How do we find an inverse <em>algebraically</em>? Algebraically speaking, the only thing we know about its inverse is that if we plug it back into the original function, we’ll get just <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> back. We’ll get back to where we started. The inverse will cancel out the original function. In other words, we need to have: <span class="math display">\[f\Big(\, f^\text{inv}(x)\, \Big) = x \]</span> But we know what <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is, so really, what we mean here is: <span class="math display">\[ 2\Big(\, f^\text{inv}(x)\, \Big) ^3 + 5 = x\]</span> So… now we can just do some algebra and solve for <span class="math inline">\(f^\text{inv}(x)\)</span>! We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2\Big(\, f^\text{inv}(x)\, \Big) ^3 + 5 &amp;= x \\ \\
2\Big(\, f^\text{inv}(x)\, \Big) ^3 &amp;= x - 5 \\ \\
\Big(\, f^\text{inv}(x)\, \Big) ^3 &amp;= \frac{x - 5}{2} \\ \\
\sqrt[3]{\Big(\, f^\text{inv}(x)\, \Big) ^3} &amp;= \sqrt[3]{\frac{x - 5}{2}} \\ \\
 f^\text{inv}(x) &amp;= \sqrt[3]{\frac{x - 5}{2}}
\end{align*}\]</span> Yay! So we’ve found it! We’ve computed the inverse. (And that does indeed look like what we found in our picture/drawing. The original function is <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span> vertically stretched by a factor of two and then shifted up five; the inverse is the cube root of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, shifted five to the right and vertically compressed by a factor of two.)</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<li>
Hey! In my example of drawing a function and its inverse, the two functions/inverses seem to meet/touch at one point. Where???
</li>
<li>
Give an example of a function whose inverse isn’t itself a function!
</li>
<li>
I said that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{f(x)}\)</span> isn’t the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. And it’s true that, given some function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, its reciprocal isn’t <em>always</em>, or even <em>usually</em> <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{f(x)}\)</span>. But is it <em>ever</em>? In other words, can you find an example of a function, such that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\text{that function}}\)</span> is its inverse?
</li>
<li>
Note that not every function has an inverse that is itself a function. Why not? Come up with an example of a function whose inverse isn’t a function. For functions we have a “vertical line test” for functionality—can you come up with a similar test to automatically determine whether a given function has an inverse function? (This, by the way, is where commutativity of inverses begins to break down—where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> being the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> doesn’t mean that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.)
<li>
<p>Can you come up with a function(s) that is (are) its own inverse(s)?!? (The fun mathematical name for such a function is an <strong>involution</strong>.) What are the necessary algebraic/graphical properties of such a function?</p>
