</div>
<h2 id="leah-odonnell-i">Leah O’Donnell I</h2>
<p>A while ago, we had this problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been trapped in an underground dungeon by an evil sorceress, Leah O’Donnell, tall, with long, flowing blonde hair, dressed in all black. With a cackle, O’Donnell tells you, “I will never free you from this prison until you calculate the coefficient on the <span class="math inline">\(a^{86}b^{72}\)</span> term of the expansion of <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^{158}\)</span>!” Her cackle is long and loud. It echoes endlessly off the dark damp concrete walls of the dungeon. You frown. O’Donnell is clearly expecting you to multiply out <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^n\)</span> by hand, all the way up to <span class="math inline">\(n=158\)</span>. But maybe there’s a better way…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm. There are lots of bad options here. We could multiply out, by hand, <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^{158}\)</span>, and look at what the coefficient is on the <span class="math inline">\(a^{86}b^{72}\)</span> term. That sounds awful.</p>
<p>Suppose we <em>were</em> to actually multiply it all out. What would we expect? What would we get, at the end of the day? We’d get a bunch of terms (<span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> of them, or rather, <span class="math inline">\(159\)</span>), where each term looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a coefficient</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> raised to some power</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> raised to some power</li>
</ul>
<p>What else would we know? Each term has <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> raised to some power, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> raised to some power, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>the powers of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> run from <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> down to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span></li>
<li>the powers of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> run from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> up to <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span></li>
<li>the power of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, plus the power of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, always add up to exactly <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>But what about these coefficients on each term? What about the number in front of the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>? We’ve noticed there’s a connection between multiplying out binomials—expanding things like <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^n\)</span>—and Pascal’s triangle and choosing and combinations. Where do the coefficients come from? We’ve seen that when we multiply out <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^n\)</span>, the coefficients are drawn from Pascal’s triangle:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{rccccccccccccc}
({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^0= &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^1= &amp;&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; {\color{red}a} &amp;+ &amp; {\color{blue}b} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^2= &amp;&amp; &amp; &amp; {\color{red}a^2} &amp;+  &amp; 2{\color{red}a}{\color{blue}b} &amp; + &amp; {\color{blue}b^2} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^3= &amp;&amp; &amp; {\color{red}a^3} &amp; + &amp; 3{\color{red}a^2}{\color{blue}b} &amp; + &amp; 3{\color{red}a}{\color{blue}b^2} &amp; + &amp; {\color{blue}b^3} &amp; &amp; \\
({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^4= &amp;&amp; {\color{red}a^4} &amp;+ &amp; 4{\color{red}a^3}{\color{blue}b} &amp; +&amp; 6{\color{red}a^2}{\color{blue}b^2} &amp; +&amp; 4{\color{red}a}{\color{blue}b^3} &amp; +&amp; {\color{blue}b^4} &amp; \\
({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^5 = &amp;{\color{red}a^5} &amp; + &amp; 5{\color{red}a^4}{\color{blue}b} &amp; + &amp; 10{\color{red}a^3}{\color{blue}b^2} &amp; + &amp; 10{\color{red}a^2}{\color{blue}b^3} &amp;+ &amp; 5{\color{red}a}{\color{blue}b^4} &amp; +&amp; {\color{blue}b^5} \\
\text{etc.}
\end{array}\]</span>
<p>So we just need to write out Pascal’s triangle down to <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> lines! Then we’ll be able to figure out the answer.</p>
<p>… this also sounds awful.</p>
OK, better strategy. Where are these coefficients in Pascal’s triangle coming from? One way of thinking about them is that they’re coming from adding up the two entries right above them. That’s fine. But another way to think about them is that they’re <em>combinations</em>. They’re like the pizza toppings. When we multiply out, for example, <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^5\)</span>, we’re finding every way of combining either an <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or a <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> from each of those five factors: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^5 &amp;= ({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b}) \\ \\
&amp;\text{...multiply it all out}\\
&amp;\quad\quad\text{combining every combination of one term from each factor...}\\ \\
&amp;= {\color{red}a^5} + 5{\color{red}a^4}{\color{blue}b} + 10{\color{red}a^3}{\color{blue}b^2} + 10{\color{red}a^2}{\color{blue}b^3} + 5{\color{red}a}{\color{blue}b^4} + {\color{blue}b^5}
\end{align*}\]</span> If we want five <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s (the <span class="math inline">\(a^5\)</span> term), there’s only one way to do it. If we want four <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s and one <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (the <span class="math inline">\(a^4b\)</span> term), there are five ways to do it. If we want three <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s and two <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s (the <span class="math inline">\(a^3b^2\)</span> term), there are five choose two ways to do it: <span class="math display">\[\text{the coefficient on the $a^3b^2$ term:}\quad _{5}\mathrm{C}_{2} = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10\]</span> If we want two <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s and three <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s, there are five choose three ways to do it: <span class="math display">\[\text{the coefficient on the $a^2b^3$ term:}\quad _{5}\mathrm{C}_{3} = \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = 10\]</span> If we want one <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and four <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s, there are five choose four ways to do it: <span class="math display">\[\text{the coefficient on the $ab^4$ term:}\quad _{5}\mathrm{C}_{4} = \binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = 5\]</span> And finally, if we want zero <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s and five <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s, there are five choose five ways to do it: <span class="math display">\[\text{the coefficient on the $b^5$ term:}\quad _{5}\mathrm{C}_{5} = \binom{5}{5} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-5)!} = 1\]</span> So really, these coefficients are all combinations!!! Really, Pascal’s triangle is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{rccccccccccccc}

({\color{red}a}+{\color{blue}b})^1= &amp;&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \binom{1}{0}{\color{red}a} &amp;+ &amp; \binom{1}{1}{\color{blue}b} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\

<p>Here, we’re trying to multiply out <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^{158}\)</span>. So we’re choosing from <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> multiplications/options. If we want the coefficient on the <span class="math inline">\(a^{86}b^{72}\)</span> term—well, there are <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> choose <span class="math inline">\(86\)</span> ways to select only <span class="math inline">\(86\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s from these <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> factors! So the answer is: <span class="math display">\[\binom{158}{86} a^{86}b^{72}\]</span> Or, if you prefer <span class="math inline">\({}_n \mathrm{ C }_k\)</span> notation: <span class="math display">\[{}_{158} \mathrm{ C }_{86} a^{86}b^{72}\]</span> Alternatively, we could think of this in terms of the number of ways we could choose the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s. We have <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> total factors, and we want to choose <span class="math inline">\(72\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s, so this is, equivalently, <span class="math inline">\(158\)</span> choose <span class="math inline">\(72\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\binom{158}{72} a^{86}b^{72} \quad\text{or}\quad {}_{158} \mathrm{ C }_{72}a^{86}b^{72} \]</span> Either way, as an “actual number” (an overrated concept), the coefficient works out to be: <span class="math display">\[12,\!492,\!285,\!575,\!801,\!524,001,\!867,\!680,\!351,\!343,\!564,\!302,\!637,\!534,\!950\]</span> So the full term is: <span class="math display">\[12,\!492,\!285,\!575,\!801,\!524,001,\!867,\!680,\!351,\!343,\!564,\!302,\!637,\!534,\!950a^{86}b^{72}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="can-we-compute-the-powers-of-2">Can we compute the powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>?!?</h2>
<p>What’s <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>? We don’t know! No idea! We’ve never known how to find powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>! <span class="math display">\[2^n = \quad ???\]</span> Like, for example, what’s <span class="math inline">\(2^5\)</span>? Who knows! Sounds like a Fields Medal-level question! <span class="math display">\[2^5 = \quad ???\]</span> Now that we’ve spent all this time playing around with expanding <span class="math inline">\((a+b)^n\)</span>, of doing binomial expansions and Pascal’s triangle and binomial coefficients and the like, we can figure it out! After all, <span class="math inline">\(2=1+1\)</span>. So if we want to find <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>, it’s the same as <span class="math inline">\((1+1)^n\)</span>—which, thanks to all the stuff we’ve learned, we know how to do!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2^n = (1+1)^n &amp;= \text{we can expand this using Pascal&#39;s triangle}\\
&amp;\quad\quad\text{/the binomial theorem/etc.!}\end{align*}\]</span> In the past we’ve been able to find smaller powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> by using, like, FOIL or something: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2^2 = (1+1)^2 &amp;= (1+1)(1+1) \\
&amp;= \underbrace{1\cdot1}_{\text{first}} + \underbrace{1\cdot 1}_{\text{outer}} + \underbrace{1\cdot 1}_{\text{inner}} + \underbrace{1\cdot 1}_{\text{last}} \\
&amp;= 1^2 + 2\cdot 1 + 1^2 \\
&amp;= 1 + 2 + 1 \\
&amp;= 4
\end{align*}\]</span> And now, using the full power of the binomial theorem and Pascal’s triangle and whatnot, we can find higher powers easily! For example, we can finally figure out <span class="math inline">\(2^5\)</span>! It’s just: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}2^5 = (1+1)^5 &amp;=\text{the coefficients from row \#5 of Pascal&#39;s triangle,} \\
&amp;\quad\quad\text{together with decreasing powers of $1$ and increasing powers of $1$}\\ \\

&amp;= 1 \,\,+\,\, 5  \,\,+\,\,  10 \,+\,  10 \,\,+\,\,  5 \,\,+\,\,  1\\  \\

\end{align*}
\]</span> … okay this is obviously all quite silly. We know that <span class="math inline">\(2^5=32\)</span>. We’ve known that for years. We don’t need the binomial theorem and Pascal’s triangle to figure it out. We don’t need to use FOIL to compute <span class="math inline">\(2^2\)</span>. Doing so makes things <em>more</em> complicated, not less. But that’s the point: this is <em>humor</em>. We’re being <em>silly</em> and <em>ridiculous</em> and <em>playful</em>, intellectually so. It’s on-theme with Sydni’s charge for us this week to be playful. Being playful isn’t just about jumping in the bouncy house and sucking on Otter Pops—the intellectual, creative work that we do in school can <em>itself</em> be playful. And it should be. (Being playful doesn’t mean it’s any less serious.)</p>
<p>This is a good example! We don’t <em>need</em> the binomial theorem to compute <span class="math inline">\(2^5\)</span>. But we <em>can</em> use the binomial theorem to compute it, so why not, just for fun? All the time in life we do things we don’t <em>need</em> to do, just for the fun of it. We don’t <em>need</em> to go on a hike. We could just drive. We don’t <em>need</em> to cook our own food. We can just go out to a restaurant or order in. (Increasingly: we don’t <em>need</em> to write things, when we can have an LLM do it… and yet I’m writing all this by hand! Why would I cede my pleasure to an LLM?) In October I spent a long weekend in Yosemite with Spencer, the middle school math teacher, and the last climb we did (at 10 PM, by moonlight) was a climb we’d both done a zillion times. Just for fun, we decided to climb it in deliberately silly ways: choosing harder variations, or setting constraints (“climb this segment without hands”), just for the fun of it, just to <em>play</em> on the rock.</p>
<p>Here’s another example of playfulness in math. One of my favorite theorems in calculus is what’s called Taylor’s Theorem. Taylor’s Theorem says (basically) that everything is a polynomial. You prove it by doing some standard calculus techniques/procedures—except, at every decision point/juncture in those procedures, you make <em>the stupidest possible decision</em>. Or, put more lightly, you make <em>the silliest, the most absurd, the most ridiculous possible decision</em>. The proof is <em>funny</em>! The proof is <em>comedy</em>. And yet we get this very beautiful and very deep result. It’s a result which (unlike <span class="math inline">\(2^5=32\)</span>) we probably couldn’t have gotten more easily<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Out of comedy, we get truth. That’s an important point. Humor and playfulness aren’t just things that are valuable in and of themselves; they’re also <em>a path towards truth</em>.</p>
That’s relevant here as well. Computing <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> using binomial coefficients and Pascal’s triangle doesn’t tell us anything new about <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>. But it <em>does</em> tell us something new about Pascal’s triangle and the binomial coefficients. Remember the observation that some of you made, that if we add up all the numbers in any given row of Pascal’s triangle, they sum to a power of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>?
<span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{rcccccccccccccc}
 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; = 1\\

 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; {\color{gray}{+}} &amp; 2 &amp; {\color{gray}{+}} &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; = 4\\

\end{array}\]</span>
This is a proof of that! This is a proof, or at least the core idea of a proof, that the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>’th row of Pascal’s triangle sums to <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span>:

<p><em>Out of play, truth.</em> That should be our motto: <em>Ex ludo veritas.</em></p>
<h2 id="feynman-on-playfulness">Feynman on playfulness</h2>
<p>In his memoir, <em>Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman</em> (which you all should read), the physicist Richard Feynman writes about his feelings of burnout as a young professor in the late 1940s. He was young, but not <em>that</em> young; he had already done a lot of important work, but he had fallen into a routine as a physics professor; he was admired and respected and acclaimed, but full of ennui, and not feeling excited about physics or his research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So here I was, “burned out,” reading the <em>Arabian Nights</em> and feeling depressed about myself …</p>
<p>Then I had another thought. Physics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to enjoy doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to play with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing—it didn’t have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with. When I was in high school, I’d see water running out of a faucet growing narrower, and wonder if I could figure out what determines that curve. I found it was rather easy to do. I didn’t have to do it; it wasn’t important for the future of science; somebody else had already done it. That didn’t make any difference. I’d invent things and play with things for my own entertainment.</p>
<p>So I got this new attitude. Now that I am burned out and I’ll never accomplish anything, I’ve got this nice position at the university teaching classes which I rather enjoy, and just like I read the <em>Arabian Nights</em> for pleasure, I’m going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance whatsoever.</p>
<p>Within a week I was in the cafeteria and some guy, fooling around, throws a plate in the air. As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty obvious to me that the medallion went around faster than the wobbling.</p>
<p>I had nothing to do, so I start to figure out the motion of the rotating plate. I discover that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as fast as the wobble rate. Then I thought, “Is there some way I can see in a more fundamental way, by looking at the forces or the dynamics?”</p>
<p>I don’t remember how I did it, but I ultimately worked out what the motion of the mass particles is, and how all the accelerations balance… I still remember going to Hans Bethe and saying, “Hey, Hans! I noticed something interesting. Here the plate goes around so, and the reason it’s two to one is …” and I showed him the accelerations.</p>
<p>He says,”Feynman, that’s pretty interesting, but what’s the importance of it? Why are you doing it?”</p>
<p>“Hah!” I say. ”There’s no importance whatsoever. I’m just doing it for the fun of it." His reaction didn’t discourage me; I had made up my mind I was going to enjoy physics and do whatever I liked.</p>
<p>It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. I almost tried to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing, but ultimately there was. The diagrams and the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="math-isnt-about-exactitude-whats-2.055">Math isn’t about exactitude: what’s <span class="math inline">\(2.05^5\)</span>?</h2>
<p>Here’s another interesting question: can we estimate <span class="math inline">\(2.05^5\)</span>? Not <em>compute it exactly</em>, note, <em>estimate</em> it.</p>
<p>If we want to know what <span class="math inline">\(2.05^5\)</span> is exactly, we could do it in a straightforward-but-tedious way: just do a lot of multiplications. I don’t even <em>remember</em> how to do elementary school long multiplication, but I guess we’d set up something like: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2.05&amp; \\
\times 2.05 \\
\hline
\end{align*}\]</span> And, like, multiply <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span>, and so put a <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> or something down and carry the two or something like that: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2.\cancel{0}^25&amp; \\
\times 2.05 \\
\hline
5&amp;
\end{align*}\]</span> I’m not even sure how to multiply like that any more. I haven’t done it since elementary school! I either multiply things in my head using whatever random heuristics I’ve built up over the years, or use a calculator. It seems <em>easy</em>, but tedious and boring (and we have to do it like five times!).</p>
<p>Here’s another idea. What if we just use our newfound binomial-theorem/Pascal’s triangle to <em>approximate</em> it? To get a not-exact, but <em>good-enough</em> answer??? After all, when we multiply things in our heads, that’s kind of what we do (or at least what <em>I</em> do). Like, for example, if I have to multiply <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> in my head, I’ll think, “Well, <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(130\)</span>, and then there are two more <span class="math inline">\(13s\)</span>, so it’s <span class="math inline">\(130 + 13 + 13\)</span>, or just <span class="math inline">\(130+26\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(156\)</span>.” So it’s like I’m approximating it by using convenient nearby numbers (like the closest multiple of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, for example), and then refining it to get the exact answer. If speed is an issue, I can just say, “What’s <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>? A bit more than <span class="math inline">\(130\)</span>!”</p>
<p>What about <span class="math inline">\(2.05^5\)</span>? Getting the exact answer, by hand, seems unpleasant. Can we approximate it? <span class="math inline">\(2^5\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(32\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\((2.05)^5\)</span> is probably <em>about</em> <span class="math inline">\(32\)</span>. A little bit more. Not that much more. But <em>how</em> much more?</p>
<p>We can use the binomial theorem/Pascal’s triangle ideas to approximate it! <span class="math inline">\(2.05\)</span>, after all, is just <span class="math inline">\(2+.05\)</span>. So if we’re raising it to the fifth, we have <span class="math inline">\((2+.05)^5\)</span>, and that looks like a binomial bad boy!!! So, if we think about the relavent line of Pascal’s triangle, we’ll have something like: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(2.05)^5 &amp;= (2+0.05)^5 \\ \\
&amp;= \left(2 + \frac{1}{20}\right)^5 \\ \\
&amp;= 1\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^5}{\color{blue}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^0} \,\,+\,\, 5\!\cdot\! {\color{red}2^4}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^1} \,\,+\,\, 10\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^3}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^2} \,+\, 10\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^2}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^3} \,\,+\,\, 5\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^1}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^4} \,\,+\,\, 1\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^0}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^5}
\end{align*}\]</span> This does not look much nicer!!! It’s different than multiplying out <span class="math inline">\(2.05^5\)</span> by hand using the elementary-school method, but it still looks awful and miserable.</p>
<p>But there’s a trick! Or rather, there’s no trick: there’s something to <em>notice</em>. (Important life lesson: there are no tricks; there’s just <em>better observation.</em>) In our binomial expansion, each term consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a binomial coefficient
<ul>
<li>in this case: <span class="math inline">\(1,5,10,10,5,1\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>a power of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>
<ul>
<li>in this case: <span class="math inline">\({\color{red} 2^5,2^4,2^3,2^2,2^1,2^0}\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>a power of <span class="math inline">\(1/20\)</span>
<ul>
<li>in this case: <span class="math inline">\({\color{blue} \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^0, \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^1, \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^2, \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^3, \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^4, \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^5 }\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s re-organize this a bit. I’m going to distribute the powers of <span class="math inline">\(1/20\)</span> into the fraction, and also move the powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> onto the top of the same fraction: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= 1\cdot {\color{red}2^5}{\color{blue}\frac{1^0}{20^0}} \,\,+\,\, 5\!\cdot\! {\color{red}2^4}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\frac{1^1}{20^1}} \,\,+\,\, 10\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^3}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\frac{1^2}{20^2}} \,+\, 10\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^2}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\frac{1^3}{20^3}} \,\,+\,\, 5\!\cdot\!{\color{red}2^1}\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\frac{1^4}{20^4}} \,\,+\,\, 1\!\cdot\!{\color{blue}\frac{1^5}{20^5}} \\ \\
&amp;= 1\!\cdot\!\frac{{\color{red} 2^5}}{{\color{blue} 20^0}} \,\,+\,\,5\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 2^4}}{{\color{blue}20^1}} \,\,+\,\, 10\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 2^3}}{{\color{blue}20^2}} \,\,+\,\,  10\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 2^2}}{{\color{blue}20^3}} \,\,+\,\,  5\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 2^1}}{{\color{blue}20^4}} \,\,+\,\,  1\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 2^0}}{{\color{blue}20^5}}
\end{align*}\]</span> Think about what’s going on with those powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and the powers of <span class="math inline">\(1/20\)</span>. The powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> get bigger and bigger, as we raise them to bigger powers! But the powers of <span class="math inline">\(1/20\)</span> get smaller and smaller, as we raise them to bigger and bigger powers: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= 1\!\cdot\!\frac{{\color{red} 32}}{{\color{blue} 1}} \,\,+\,\,5\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 16}}{{\color{blue}20}} \,\,+\,\, 10\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 8}}{{\color{blue}400}} \,\,+\,\,  10\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 4}}{{\color{blue}8\!,\!000}} \,\,+\,\,  5\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 2}}{{\color{blue}160\!,000}} \,\,+\,\,  1\!\cdot\!\frac{ {\color{red} 1}}{{\color{blue}3\!,200\!,000}}
\end{align*}\]</span> It’s like a <em>battle</em> between the powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and the powers of <span class="math inline">\(120\)</span>! But… it’s actually not much of a battle, because they’re both going in the same direction. Or rather, they’re going in opposite directions, but towards the same goal. The powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> go down as the powers of <span class="math inline">\(1/20\)</span> go up. As the exponent on <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> goes down, <span class="math inline">\(2^\text{exponent}\)</span> gets smaller. As the exponent on <span class="math inline">\(1/20\)</span> goes up, <span class="math inline">\((1/20)^\text{exponent}\)</span> gets smaller. So the further and further to the right we get, the smaller and smaller the terms get!!! Let’s simplify this a bit more: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= {\color{red} 32} \,\,+\,\,\frac{ 5\!\cdot\!{\color{red} 16}}{{\color{blue}20}} \,\,+\,\, \frac{10\!\cdot\! {\color{red} 8}}{{\color{blue}400}} \,\,+\,\, \frac{  10\!\cdot\!{\color{red} 4}}{{\color{blue}8\!,\!000}} \,\,+\,\,  \frac{ 5\!\cdot\!{\color{red} 2}}{{\color{blue}160\!,000}} \,\,+\,\,  \frac{ {\color{red} 1}}{{\color{blue}3\!,200\!,000}} \\ \\
&amp;= 32 + \frac{80}{20} + \frac{80}{400} + \frac{40}{8,\!000} + \frac{10}{160,\!000} + \frac{1}{3,\!200,\!000} \\ \\
&amp;= 32 + 4  + 0.2 + \frac{40}{8,\!000} + \frac{10}{160,\!000} + \frac{1}{3,\!200,\!000}
\end{align*}\]</span> Look at that!!! The terms start big—they start with that big bad <span class="math inline">\(2^5=32\)</span> term—and then get smaller and smaller! It’s like the binomial theorem/Pascal’s triangle is <em>already</em> approximating this for us!!! <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= \underbrace{32}_{\text{big}} + \underbrace{4}_{\text{smaller}} + \underbrace{0.2}_{\text{small}} + \underbrace{\frac{40}{8,\!000}}_{\text{very small}} + \underbrace{\frac{10}{160,\!000}}_{\text{extremely small}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{3,\!200,\!000}}_{\text{basically zero}} \\ \\
&amp;= 32 + 4  + 0.2 + 0.005 + 0.0000625 +0.000000325
\end{align*}\]</span> I worked out those smaller terms with a calculator… but really, the first two or three terms are easy to work out by hand. If we take just the first three terms, it’s a pretty good approximation!! <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(2.05)^5 &amp;\approx 32 + 4 + 0.2 \\
&amp;\approx 36.2
\end{align*}\]</span> Liam wrote this problem, and so I was surprised when I actually worked it out. I thought <span class="math inline">\(2.05^5\)</span> was going to be like <span class="math inline">\(32.5\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(33\)</span> or something, not <span class="math inline">\(36\)</span>!</p>
<p>Here’s what the approximation looks like, as we add more and more terms: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp;= \underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{32 + 4}_{=36}  + 0.2}_{=36.2} + \frac{40}{8,\!000}}_{=36.205} + \frac{10}{160,\!000}}_{=36.2050625} + \frac{1}{3,\!200,\!000}}_{=36.2050628125}
\end{align*}\]</span> The more and more terms we add, the closer and closer we get to the actual value! But just the first couple terms gets us pretty close.</p>

<p>There’s another big idea here. If we’re trying to get the <em>perfect</em> answer for <span class="math inline">\(2.05^5\)</span>, the process will be really hard and long and tedious. But we can get a good-enough answer pretty easily!</p>
<p>Too often we think of math as being about <em>details</em>. As requiring this binary between true and false, right and wrong, good and evil. But it’s so much more complicated than that. When we get so focused on the details, we don’t see the bigger picture. We miss the forest for the trees. Sometimes when we zoom out, make things fuzzier and blurrier—deliberately don’t worry about the details—we can actually see more clearly. If we’re focused on all the tiny details, we can miss the bigger patterns. Sometimes squinting at a painting—blurring all the brushstrokes—can actually help us see it better.</p>
<p>(Also, there’s a way in which a calculation like this is foreshadowing some of the ideas of calculus! I’ll leave it at that.)</p>
<h2 id="leah-odonnell-ii">Leah O’Donnell II</h2>
<p>We’ve escaped from Leah O’Donnell’s dungeon. Our situation is improved in some ways, and worse in other ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have escaped from Leah O’Donnell’s dark damp decrepit dungeon!!! You find yourself on the Upper West Side, at 96th and Amsterdam, phoneless, moneyless, all alone. You need to get down to your office in Union Square, at 14th and Broadway. It’s Manhattan: a perfect grid. The streets run east-west (well, more like northwest-southeast); the avenues run north-south (more like northeast/southwest—the Manhattan grid is about 29 degrees off-axis. Blame Manhattan Island for itself behind about 29 degrees off from running perfectly north-south). Anyway, you have to get back to your offices! Obviously you want to get there as fast as possible. You’re not going to do something stupid like travel by way of New Jersey or Quebec. You’re going to take the shortest path. Well, not the <em>shortest</em> shortest path: that’d be a straight line, which would take you through buildings, and you can’t do that. This is real life, not a video game. You have to follow the street grid. You have to make a series of left and right turns to make it to Union Square. But there are so many options! Do you walk all the way south to 14th St., and then turn east to get to Union Square? Do you immediately walk east, and then turn south to walk to Union Square??? (Amsterdam Ave., note, is 10th Avenue, and Union Square is at 4th Avenue.) Your confinement in O’Donnell’s dungeon has only heightened your anxiety. You feel paralyzed by the possibilities before you. <em>How many ways are there to get to Union Square the fastest</em>?!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of details going on with the Manhattan street grid, but abstracted, our situation looks like:</p>
<p><img src="96th-to-union-square-1.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah; Central Park’s in the way, there’s Broadway, etc… just imagine we’re in this idealized/abstracted grid world! (And go read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioners%27_Plan_of_1811">Commissioners’ Plan of 1811</a> if you want to know more about the history of the Manhattan street grid!)</p>
<p>One way we could walk would be to go directly east along 96th St for six blocks, and then turn south on 4th Ave. and walk for 82 blocks, for a walk of 88 total blocks:</p>
<p><img src="96th-to-union-square-2.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, we could go directly south on Amsterdam for 82 blocks, and then turn east and go along 14th street for six blocks, for a walk of 88 total blocks:</p>
<p><img src="96th-to-union-square-3.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Both these ways of getting to Union Square are the same distance: 82 blocks south, and 6 blocks east! 88 blocks total!<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> So are there only two shortest ways of getting to Union Square??? No! We could take some zig-zaggy mixture:</p>
<p><img src="96th-to-union-square-4.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>It turns out that any zig-zaggy-in-between path will <em>also</em> be 88 total blocks! It’ll <em>also</em> be 82 blocks south and 6 blocks east. Why? Imagine we take one of these zig-zaggy paths, and then, like, project it as far east and as far south as we can:</p>
<p><img src="96th-to-union-square-5.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>It’s going to form an L-shape, 82 blocks tall and 6 blocks wide! No matter what zig-zaggy combination of turns we take inside this box, they’ll always add up to six total blocks east and 82 blocks south. (Of course we could go in circles inside the box or something, but we’re talking about the <em>shortest</em> paths.)</p>
<p><img src="96th-to-union-square-6.svg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>So to count all the shortest paths from 96th and Amsterdam to Union Square, we need to not just count the two paths on the “outside,” but also all these zig-zaggy paths in between!!! How many are there? There must be dozens! Hundreds! How do we count them all up? How do we make sure we haven’t missed any? How do we make sure we haven’t counted any twice?</p>
<p>Well… the same reasoning we used to see that all these zig-zaggy paths have the same length is the reasoning we can use to count them all up! No matter what path we take, we’ll have to walk six blocks east. No matter what path we take, we’ll have to walk 82 blocks south. So no matter what path we take, we have to walk 88 blocks. Six of them must be east. 82 of them must be south. How do we take the 88 total blocks we walk, and choose six of them to be east?</p>
<p>… it’s a combination!!!</p>
<p>We’re walking <span class="math inline">\(88\)</span> total blocks, and we need to choose to walk six of them eastwards, so the total number of paths is: <span class="math display">\[\binom{88}{6} = _{88}\mathrm{C}_{6} = \frac{88!}{6!(88-6)!} = 541,931,236\]</span> Alternatively described, we’re walking <span class="math inline">\(88\)</span> total blocks, and we need to choose to walk 82 of them south, so the total number of paths is: <span class="math display">\[\binom{88}{82} = _{88}\mathrm{C}_{82} = \frac{88!}{82!(88-82)!} = 541,931,236\]</span> Notice how, algebraically, we can see that these two descriptions—choose six blocks to go east on, or choose <span class="math inline">\(82\)</span> blocks to go south down—are the same: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\substack{\text{walk $88$ blocks, choosing}\\\text{$6$ of them to go east}}&amp;= \binom{88}{6} \\ \\

<p>Either way, it’s a lot of possibilities! <span class="math inline">\(542\)</span> million different, equally-short ways to walk to Union Square! Talk about the <strong>paradox of choice</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-1.955">What about <span class="math inline">\((1.95)^5\)</span>?</h2>
<p>We used the binomial theorem to estimate <span class="math inline">\((2.05)^5\)</span>. Can we use it to estimate <span class="math inline">\((1.95)^5\)</span>??? This should be basically the same: we estimated <span class="math inline">\((2.05)^5\)</span> by breaking it up into <span class="math inline">\((2\)</span> plus <span class="math inline">\(.05)^5\)</span>; here, we can break up <span class="math inline">\((1.95)^5\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\((2\)</span> <em>minus</em> <span class="math inline">\(.05)^5\)</span>, and again use the binomial theorem. Presumably we’ll get the same-ish result? We had: <span class="math display">\[(2.05)^5 \quad=\quad 2^5 + \text{(a little bit}) \quad\approx\quad 32 + 4.2 \quad\approx\quad 36.4 \]</span> Here we’re <em>subtracting</em> <span class="math inline">\(.05\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, not adding it, so I guess we’ll get: <span class="math display">\[(1.95)^5 \quad=\quad 2^5 - \text{(a little bit}) \quad\overset{???}{\approx}\quad 32 - 4.2 \quad\overset{???}{\approx}\quad 27.8 \]</span> Yeah???</p>

<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>OK, it’s tempting to say “88 total blocks,” which is fine in an an abstract/idealized/mathematical sense; in practicality, the east-west block distance in New York is about three times as long as the north-south block distance. New Yorkers refer to “short blocks” and “long blocks.” They’re different units! So this situation is 82 short blocks, and 6 long blocks. But that doesn’t actually make a difference in our calculations.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
